If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.

As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.

I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.

For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.

This is my new favorite place in the valley. I can't wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!",1,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

My daughter has attended many wonderful birthday parties here. This is a great birthday facility for toddlers - tweens. 

Before you go into the rooms, the kids and adults watch a video about safety on the slides and bounce rooms. One of the rules they emphasize is *getting out of the way* when you get to the bottom of the slide so you don't get hit by the next kid/adult on the slide.

Well, my beautiful girl did not listen carefully, got all spaced out at the bottom of a slide, and slammed by some kid at the party. Next thing I know, she is screaming in my arms  that her arm hurts. The party starts to move into the next bounce room, and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to calm down my screamer and get in the other room so the next party can start in the first bounce room. Every time, I moved, the screaming increased a few decibels. The people that worked there came to assess the situation and help, but I told them proudly that I had it all under control. Then I fainted. 

I woke up in some big man's arms all confused. When you wake up dazed and confused in a stranger's arms, the first thing you do is make sure you have clothes on. Check! Next thing was panic - where is my little girl? When I fainted, the party moved quickly to the other room with all the kids including my screamer, and three parents and two staff members stayed behind to revive me. My husband picked us up and I have been too embarrassed to go back since.

Even though I have to wear a helmet to parties here, I still think it's a great place and highly recommend it! Just make sure your kid is well rested before they get there, and maybe run through some fire drills on quickly getting out of the way.",0,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

We started w/ the sangria-style cocktail - a yummy blend of red wine, brandy and triple sec w/ an orange rind garnish. They were potent and delish! 

For starters, fois gras and mussels. The Fois Gras melted in your mouth like butter and was served w/ grilled peaches and a small piece of grilled bread - it was SO SO GOOD. One of the most wonderful things I have ever  put in my mouth! The mussels were amazing as well, served in a simple thick pernod lemon butter with leeks. They brought us bread so we could enjoy every bit of the broth.

For entrees, we had steak frite and duck confit. The duck was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone with crispy skin and a perfect amount of sauce and vegie medley The steak frite was to-die-for - medium rare was perfectly red - every bite melted in my mouth - it was truly heavenly.

For desert, we had the chocolate creme brulee - it was perfectly caramelized over the entire surface! As a creme brulee connoisseur, I can tell you that nothing is more disappointing than a half-assed caramelized top - this one set a new standard for how creme brulee should be done!

You definitely want to make a reservation for this place - it's a tiny little cozy room with a bar and lots of tiny tables. It was cramped, but I never felt like I didn't have enough space. This is not a superficial spot - people were dressed casually and everyone in the place was having a great time. This is not a place to eat with children, but fantastic for a date night.

Sometimes, people don't know what a little tiny purse size dog weighs, and  they bring them in  the wrong yard. It is always fun to watch a lab try to wrestle with a chihuahua. 

Some people also feel it is necessary to keep their dog on a leash even though there are large gates protecting the dogs from escaping. My friends, if your dog does not behave off the leash, it does not belong in a dog park with other dogs. :)

These two issues - dog size and leash/no-leash - exist at dog parks near and far - I just like  to help gently guide those new to the scene.

Also, never wear clothes you love to a dog park.  You may be confused for a lamp post or fire hydrant, and become a conduit for pee-mail.  Watching spaced out dog owners get sniffed and peed on is funny no matter how many times you see it happen.

Bring water for yourself - there is one covered picnic table in each fenced off area. And bring a leash - you have to have your dog on t he leash until you get inside the gated area.  Great park. Big enough for the big dogs to run a lot and get tired.  Because of the separate  yards, little dogs can have fun too.",4,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

First of all, about the facility. I have done yoga in many studios and love my classes at the YMCA in Ahwatukee. This yoga studio is so so beautiful! The space is open, inviting, relaxing, and extremely clean. The hot room has ceiling fans, and when it gets too warm, the instructor opens the doors to let cool air in. Even with all the bodies in the room, there was NO stinkiness!! This was always my biggest fear about hot yoga. 

I wore capri yoga pants and a yoga top. I brought a full length towel, huge bottle of water and a yoga mat. The instructor placed me close to the door in case I needed to cool down. The class pace was perfect - flowing from one pose to the next. There was wonderful non-new-agemusic playing on a great sound system the whole time. The posture instructions were clear and easy to follow, however, I think it would be difficult for a beginner. It could be that the instructor knew there were no beginners, and therefore, didn't go slow. I had to stop three times towards the end of the class. I was too hot and my heart was beating too fast. After a three minute break (still in the room) and some water, I could finish with the class. My mat, clothes and towel were completely wet - I'm not talking damp - I mean WET. I highly recommend bringing an extra change of clothes for after class  and wearing as little clothing as respectably possible in the class!

The class costs $16 for an individual session, or $20 for two classes (two weeks in a row).

Warm mozzerella was draped  over sliced heirloom tomatoes and grilled breadwith a garlicky lemon vinaigrette.  The portion of mozzerella is a wonderfully glutinous amount of goodness. It was the best caprese dish I have ever had.  I drank a Brazil  66,  a  beautiful rum-citrus concoction that had a good punch without being  too strong or  too sweet.  For our second  course,  we shared Tuna Tare Tare - a generous portion of wonderfully fresh fatty tuna in a sesame sea salt  Poke-like sauce served with a yummy citrus ponzu sauce. As Jan G (Aka - the husband)  already mentioned, it was so good we had seconds....and we NEVER get seconds!  We also enjoyed salmon cake sliders and frog legs -both were wonderful, but the tuna tare tare and mozzarella stole the show....and just so you know,  the food at Digestif  is truly a production!

You can read  Jan G's review for the rest of what I was going to say. The man stole my thunder!",2,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

We were greeted at our table ten minutes after being seated. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, smoked salmon cheesecake and wild mushroom tart. The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived (another ten minutes)- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine. The crab and avocado tower had corn inside and gazpacho with it. We had to add salt - it was extremely bland. If you just want to taste avocado and crab, you will love it! If you want extra flava', try something else! The smoked salmon cheesecake was disappointing. A little cute cheesecake that looked smooth on the outside, but crumbled into dry cheese balls on the inside with a very tiny portion of smoked salmon served on the side. House cured smoked salmon is one of my most favorite things - this place will not be remembered for this dish. It was the first time I could describe cured salmon as bland! The one good thing that I would eat again and go back for is the wild mushroom tart. Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish. We never saw our server for most of the meal. If I went back again, I would try one of the big salads I saw at tables around us and that tart again.

I ordered the 20 inch italian - it sounded naughty. :) The roll was fresh and doughy with a slightly crunchy crust. The meat was extremely high grade deli fixings - salami, peppered ham, and some other italian salami, roasted peppers, pickles, and viniagarette. For being a sub sandwich, all three of us enjoyed it fully. BUT, it's not a deli sandwich - it's a sub.

We were at the youth museum and were looking for a late lunch on a Sunday. This place was open and the yelp reviews looked pretty good! 

Service was excellent! The waiter suggested the seafood enchilada or the Laos combo. We ordered both so we could sample the top picks. The plates are plentiful-  we could have easily shared one and just had a salad with it. Great fresh flavors! The fresh salsa is wonderful - smoky chipotle and not too overly oniony. The seafood enchiladas had halibut and salmon inside and fresh salsa verde over the top. So yummy! The trio/combo plate came with a choice of verde or red sauce - we went for red, which was the spicier variant -it was so good! Beef tenderlion with melty cheese stuffed crispy relleno was to die for! I could eat that every day!! The shrimp enchilada was so good that even the five year old wanted some more. I took the pork tomale home to eat for dinner - couldn't finish my plate! 

They don't have a kids menu, but they do have a nice kids selection the waiter will tell you verbally. Cheese pizza, pasta or quesadilla. I think there were more offerings, but that's all the waiter could say before the 5YO made her selection.

I had the ""killer margarita"" (aka: the house margarita)  and was very happy with the fresh lime flavor. Sometimes, a house margarita just tastes like sweet and sour mix w/ triple sec - this one was refreshing and delish!

I would give it five stars, but there are two things lacking for a five star review: (1) the restaurant ambiance is a little underwhelming - the chairs and tables felt warn/old/cheap and you can't tell it's a great place from the outside decor. (2) food came out warm, not hot. But the flavors were so great that it won't stop us from coming back!

Fri/Sat are really busy here - the waiter said it's a really popular spot for large parties (20-40 people) - I will remember that in case we ever have a large group event!

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by a nice gentleman with a soothing voice. A woman came over to show me the amenities, provide a locker and the coziest warmest softest bathrobe I have ever worn. Before my massage, I sat in a cozy room with a beautiful adobe fireplace where I listened to peaceful flute music and drank cucumber water. The room was so peaceful that I felt relaxed before I had the massage. There was another woman also waiting in the room, but the place is big enough for two or three to sit and not have to talk to each other. (I personally don't like chit chat before a rub down.) 

I had a 50 minute massage from a lovely gentle giant. He layed hot towels over my back and feet during the massage, and applied perfect pressure. I was in heaven the entire time. 

The pool was closed the day I was there, so I hung out in the hot tub most of the time. There was one in door and one outdoor hot tub. Both of them were lovely. The inside tub could most likely seat about five comfortably. There was a large bowl next to the hot tub filled with iced washcloths to place over your eyes - they had cucumbers in them - really interesting for someone not used to this treatment.

I tried the steam room and the sauna but just am too immature for this stuff. I felt like I couldn't breath in the sauna and I couldn't focus my eyes in the steam room. Both rooms seemed like they would be nice experiences for those who like this sort of thing.

Happy Hour Review: One of the best happy hour offerings I have seen in the valley, but not a huge $$ value. Great food choices that aren't offered on the standard menu. The hours are very limiting, and you can only sit in the extremely small bar area, so you have to be there early to get in on the HH menu. The artichoke dip and the bruschetta were wonderful!!! 

Dinner Review:
We chose outdoor seating under the beautiful trees near the fireplace. It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love! Our server was fantastic and had great suggestions! The mussels were some of the BEST I ever had - they were served in a wonderfully creamy chorizo sauce w/ yummy toasted bread for dipping. For entrees, we had the ahi wellington and the rabbit. The ahi was a little underwhelming - the presentation was gorgeous, but slightly bland. The wasabi mash fondue was just mashed potatoes with an extremely small smidge of wasabi - nothing really fondue or wasabi about it. The rabbit is one of their house specialties - it was absolutely delish! The only downside to the bunny is that it wasn't cooked until it was falling off the bone, which just isn't acceptable for a place like this. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake - it was dense and not very ooh or ahh inspiring - I've had better.

My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food, but something's missing. I expected every plate to be amazing, and was a little let down with the final delivery. I will probably go back again, but it's not my top pick for the money shelled out. I would much rather go back to Chelsae's Kitchen or Cafe Monarch.",1,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

Also, try out Zoo Lights! You can't use your membership to get it, but it's well worth the extra expense. We went in early July - dress your kids in bathing suits and bring tons of water! There are water activities everywhere, and the paths are lit up with magical lights.

At checkin, I was asked which room location I would like (all of which came with a balcony!)  - my choices included - pool view, lagoon view, quiet buildings, those located near the party area - so many choices! I was in heaven!! We chose a room overlooking the lagoon - semi close to the pool, but far enough away to have zero noise. At night, there's a fire fountain in the middle of the lagoon that was so wonderful to watch while sitting on the balcony sipping lemon drops and having deep talks.

The amenities were FANTASTIC! There are two water slides that kept us busy w/ the 5YO for hours. There are nice size gates around the pool area and it felt very safe and clean. The adult lounge area was very sleek and beautiful. Next time, we will bring friends so we can hang here and leave the kids with a babysitter at night!  All of the grounds were wonderfully lush and landscaped nicely. I never saw one piece of garbage on the ground anywhere.

The room was lovely - beautiful decor, great materials, no detail was compromised and the place was perfectly clean. Even with the loud fire fountain outside and the ice machine outside our room, our room was completely quiet inside - it was a great experience.

We bought our room with miles, but given the amazing rates, I think we will have to have one more weekend here. 

Here's a link to the great summer rates.

I should have known I was too drunk to be around big fat Greek restaurant waitresses (BFGRW) when the waitress started caressing my arm while I ordered cocktails, and I didn't pull away. That's just a bad start.

We ordered feta and olives and a *small* greek salad. The Feta and olive plate should be called 'feta plate w/ olive garnish' - there were only 8 olives on the entire huge plate. When I tried to articulate this, the BFGRW wanted to sell me more olives! I was too drunk to explain that the plate didn't actually have enough to begin with, so we let it go and didn't order any more. The *small* greek salad was interpreted by the BFGRW as the ""large"" greek salad - she obviously realized she could have her way with us. We also ordered their flight of cocktails - I would not recommend this - it tasted like gummy bears in three flavors.

Then, on one trip, all my friends were busy. They were all at CROSSFIT on party nights! The second time I went home, I started to notice incredible physical changes in my fellow party animals. One guy that had a beer gut was ripped with a six pack and huge guns.  Once again, no one wanted to party because they didn't want to screw up their crossfit routines.  I had to find out what could possibly be better than partying with my friends. That's when I found Tribal Crossfit. 

I saw an ad to try out a session and see if I liked it. Jake and I set up a time, and I met him in the gym - a warehouse/huge garage fitted with free weights, wooden boxes, and bars with long rubber things hanging down. Jake taught me about the importance of good form and basic technique for pushups, squats and pull-ups. He gave suggestions on balance, foot placement, breathing, and I was blown away at how well he could identify my body's weaknesses and strengths. After about half an hour of this, I thought the intro was over and I said ""Thanks"" thinking it was time to leave. Then Jake got a big grin on his face, and said, ""That was the warm up."" I thought he was kidding at first, but quickly realized this was no joke.  He said, ""Most people's work out is our warm up.""  I proceeded to do 25 squats, 12 pushups and 7 pull ups - over and over again. (I don't remember how many times - this was awhile ago.) 

I came home thinking that all my friends back home were nuts. Why would anyone put themselves through this on purpose? I was sore for five days strait and could barely climb stairs or reach the tall cabinets in the kitchen. I decided to wait awhile since the holidays were coming and I wasn't sure how often I would be able to go.

After the holidays, my husband tried it, and became addicted immediately. He was only sore for two days after his first session. I am still a little pissed about that. I joined about two weeks later.

Here's what I love about crossfit: every class is different and a challenge, most sessions have a timed activity which feels wonderfully competitive and pushes you a little further, I leave class feeling completely alive and de-stressed, and now, if I go a couple days without a little muscle pain, I feel the need to workout harder. I haven't been in the class long enough to see huge physical differences yet, but I feel more alive than I ever have in my life.

My friends back home gave some good advice on finding the right crossfit gym, and I am lucky I found Jake at Tribal Crossfit because he meets the criteria. Good form is really important - you want to make sure you have an instructor that is emphasizing good form over increasing weight, or you could get hurt.  Jake knows the human body so well - in the last four weeks, I've had a few aches and pains. As soon as I point them out, he is able to show me how to adjust the move to stop the pain. 

The class is a pricey. But if you think of how much it would cost to have a private trainer three - six hours a week, this is a bargain!

I HIGHLY recommend Tribal Crossfit!",2,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble.

Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?

The bartender was really funny and full of great suggestions.  

This is NOT a place I would take my preschooler - the restaurant would not mind, but there's no kid food on the menu and there is nothing entertaining about the ambiance.

I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries.

I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.
She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.
She was quick but *really* methodical.  
I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!

Upon entering, there's the obligartory scent of Nag Champa, and their retail store.  They have the cutest yoga mat bags!  There are also racks of yoga clothes and different objects to decorate your house with.  A few years ago, I bought some really cool wall hangings from India.  Prices are reasonable for a private boutique.
If you are going to take a class, they have a little cubby for your shoes before entering each studio.  SO much better than most yoga studios that just have a doormat with a pile of everyone's shoes.
The New Year's meditation workshop was run by Jesus - I mean Yogi E.

I just happened upon this place over 4 years ago.  Though the decor was a bit cheesy, it has improved over the years.
The service can't be beat!  As soon as my drink is almost empty enough to flag someone down, someone comes by and takes it for a refill.  I've never even had to remind them of what I'm drinking.
What to get?
The Thai beef sticks with peanut sauce to start.  (By the way, I never know the real names of stuff, so bear with me) They have green, red and yellow curry.  My favorite:  The red curry with shrimp and pineapple.  Ohhhhhhhhhhh my mouth starts watering as soon as I place my order.
I always get two entrees, so I can take home the leftovers. 
MY FAVORITE DISH HERE:  The catfish.  I order ""Thai hot"" and as soon as it hits the table, my head clears up and I dig in with such zest, it's like I haven't eaten for days.
I love the rice, too!  Sticky and it holds the sauces well.

They have Pellegrino in a bottle, so I got that too.  There's even a bottle opener on the wall!  How cool is that?

I got in from California this past Saturday and noticed my 16-year old cat, Daisey, was extremely lethargic and not peeing where she was supposed to.  She barely ate her nightly treat (my cats are spoiled and get a dollop of wet food at dinnertime) or the little treats I had gotten at PetSmart.  She also practically collapsed onto my lap, when she usually walks around a bit and liked every part of her little body scratched.  I texted my friend Maura, who's a veterinary neurosurgeon (#thevet) and she said she had a friend who was there right then and gave me directions.
It wasn't too far from my house.  As soon as I walked in and told them I would have to put my Daisey to sleep, they whisked her away for the arm catheter and put me in a private room.  The LAST thing you want to do in this situation is sit in a waiting room, crying.
They came in after just a few moment with my paperwork and went over all the different urns I could buy.  The price wasn't more than what I had paid at Alta Vista (will NEVER go there again!), so I signed and waited for my Daisey.  Dr Rose (I can't remember her last name!!!) is Maura's friend and brought Daisey in.  They gave me as much time as I needed, alone, with her.  I really didn't want her suffering to go on much longer, so as soon as I called, the doctor came right back in.  I got to be with Daisey until the end.
Today, I got a sympathy card in the mail and a phone call about her ashes being ready.  
Picking them up was a really quick process and, though painful, not their fault.
They have cats there that were abandoned that live there, in the office, and serve as blood donors.  How awesome is that??
I even brought Dexter with me, as I am looking for a new vet for him.  They only do emergency services, but gave me a postcard with several vets in the area.

The elevator to the roof was different - the back wall was glass so you could see the bricks as you went up to the 4th floor.  It was hot in there, though.
Got out of the elevator and I noticed all the rooms had AZ license plates to announce the room number.  Original idea!!!
Got to the roof and...it's like the world stopped.  It's only 4 floors, but the view of the city is great.  The place was empty - 10pm on a Friday night???  I guess since it was First Friday and there was quite a crowd downtown, that people were still doing the art walk.
Headed straight for a comfy couch and sat down, completely relaxed by the atmosphere.  I knew instantly that this would become a regular hangout for me.
Only gripe was that, despite us being the only patrons, the tables were covered in empty glasses and bottles.  Bartender is Dallas, a fellow Yelper.  He's friendly and super-cute!
Crowds started arriving around 11pm.  It was such a mix of people.  Dottsy and I came up with nicknames for each group: Tempe crowd (one girl was showing off her tattoo of the band Tool.  What a tool!); Scottsdale crowd (the girls asked us to take a pic, though one didn't even smile); Phoenix crowd (just regular people, not trying to impress, like us!) and then a few random folk.
Soft music in the background.  This is what I liked best.  I spend a lot of time in clubs and it was nice to be able to have a conversation without trying to shout over the music.

We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of ""micro-arugula"" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!  
We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!

Super-friendly, cracking more jokes than I was, which rarely happens.  He showed us the ropes (get it?  Ropes?  You're harnessed into ROPES!

The place is pretty big.  They mark different climbing trails with a difficulty level, and keep them color-coded.  We tried three different walls.  We had to move from one area because these two cute guys kept talking to us and I didn't want my ass sticking out from the wall, in their faces, while trying to concentrate on not slipping and dying in front of them.  
It was fun, we stayed a little over 2 hours.  I'm pretty sore, but I was wise and made an appointment for a massage for tomorrow.

Went with Sarahbear and Nathan S.  We walked the whole thing, starting at Grinders.  They had a big crowd and rotated different genres of music and belly dancing.  (what's with the belly dancing???)
There were 3 other bands ""playing"".  Never heard a song, just a lot of tuning-up.  Maybe they had stage fright?
The bike cops were cool.  Not so the drunk guy who said I knew nothing of tattoos...then said ""you don't know nuttin' 'bout paper"".  He followed the 3 of us for a few moments, ranting about my lack of paper knowledge.  
I got a bit freaked out by the Little Caesar's guy.  He looked like a giant walking penis.  He also put a flyer on my car.  Ugh.

When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one.
At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs.
We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity.
Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night.
As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one.
He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb!
As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention.
Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!",10,6kmu0mYbdpMIOZ6Y0eVsxg

The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home!
I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces.
The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.

The girl I work with has a sister that works there.  She went yesterday for lunch and brought me back some take-out to save for dinner.  I like that I can customize my order  - wrapped in cucumber instead of rice and extra wasabi, please!  I had the scallop rolls and they were yummy!  
Went the next night with Jacqui after the roller derby.  Luckily, we are on the same level with sushi - we both know we like it but aren't as versed as some.  They gave us two menus right away (I only wrote that because of another review that only had one at the table) and explained some of the things on the menu.  The cool thing is that on the back, there's a bigger explanation of each roll.  Our waitress was so-so but warmed up a bit to us as the meal went on.
Jacqui and I shared the Cowboy roll (it's a bit spicy!) and the Eel and Cucumber roll.  We each also ordered a snow crab roll.  All were *really* good.  We left stuffed, but not in a way to make you feel like after Thanksgiving dinner.  Just right!  
Our food didn't come as quickly as I thought it would, but we weren't getting antsy at the pace.  Of course, good conversation with Jacqui is always a plus!

It was just after 5 and the place was about half-full downstairs. I noticed the upstairs was empty. I asked if we could sit up there and we were given our choice of tables.
Our server was amazing! He immediately brought us chips and salsa and took our drink orders. He brought me two drinks! I'm ok with that, because usually I'm used to having servers who don't keep up with my drinks. (Diet Coke, FYI)
The chips were freshly made, and the salsa was good. We ordered a plate of nachos to share with pork on top. It's one of the best plates of nachos I've had in a very long time. We all devoured them.
As I was getting up to leave, our server brought me a Diet Coke in a to-go cup. I didn't even ask for it but wow!

It was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago.

I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off.
I got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast. 
Omelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy!
I ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT????

I had just finished at the rock gym just down the road and I was famished.  I hadn't been to this location yet and liked the one on Camelback, so I figured I'd give it a try.
The specials board should have just been erased.  I ordered the crab puffs, which were on the board, but was told about 5 minutes after I was seated that they were out.  What the heck?  Why keep it up there then?
It was 1pm on a Saturday and the place was almost completely empty.  Not a good sign.  
Our drinks were refilled often, but it took about 15 minutes to get our food.  15 minutes in an empty place on a Saturday afternoon?  It just felt like a long wait.  Luckily, the satay appetizer came out quickly.  The peanut sauce wasn't as good as most and didn't have as much peanut flavor as it did sweet.
On the plus side, I ordered my catfish dish Thai hot...and it was.  It's not 11pm and I'm definitely feeling the burn!  Strong flavors, so I really don't mind.  My dad used to say ""If you can't feel it the next day, why eat it?""  I guess I'm daddy's girl",5,6kmu0mYbdpMIOZ6Y0eVsxg

When the fish n chips special is walleye...well, you just can't say no!  The fish fry was awesome!  I haven't had walleye since my father died, and his birthday is coming up, so it was a great tribute.
5 generous pieces of fish came with super-crispy fries, tartar sauce as well as cocktail sauce, a side of coleslaw and...malt vinegar with the condiments!  
Four Peaks got it right.  Though the fish was a bit greasy on the outside, it was really tasty and fried perfectly.  There was not too much batter, so I could actually taste the fish.  Having the malt vinegar to douse the fries with gets major cool points.  Add a few dashes of salt and...mmmmyummy!

On the way to the car, we each got a funnel cake.  I had mine with just powdered sugar.  Jenni did, too.  The girls had their own, too.  One got the apple and I had a bit.  Yum!  The other got strawberries with whipped cream.  14-year old girls can eat that, ya know.  37-year olds only dream of it.

Then the entree came.  I was wanting ooey-gooey, cheese-smothered enchiladas.  I got the mushroom and spinach.  It came with a side of black beans and rice.  The enchiladas were made properly: the tortillas were soft-fried properly before adding the fillings.  But, not a lot of stuffing!

If you go, you need to anticipate that these are small plates, like tapas.  I was sitting with a few others and we all ordered different things, so we could try a bunch of stuff.  I had the mango spring rolls, and they were awesome.  They came with a yummy dipping sauce.  Also got the wasabi tofu.  Now, before you start flipping out about how nasty tofu is and blah blah blah, you need to try it at Sens.  It's lightly fried, first of all, so it's got a crisp coating.  They're creative with the different sauce flavors.  I also tried the sesame.  Both were de-lish.  
My drink was a really crisp ginger beer that had a good bite.  
Our service was great.  Not once did I have to ask for my water to be refilled.  That is my biggest pet peeve.

There were pre-printed menus on the table of the meal. It was a fixed price meal, but there were a couple appetizers you could get while waiting for the rest of the food.
I had poutine, made with tater tots, watermelon gazpacho, walleye, flank steak, and strawberry-rhubard pie. I hadn't had rhubarb in a dozen years and was soooo excited!  All of the food was amazing, but the poutine is something I am still thinking about, and it was over a week ago!
It wasn't easy to find, because I didn't realize it was in the Lexington Hotel. For some reason, I thought it was a free-standing building. The decor is pretty cool, though. The walls and pillars are covered in chalkboards and there is chalk everywhere for you to go draw whatever the heck it is you want to draw. It's a pretty open space, which I like. Oh, and the booths are huge. I'm a booth girl. Why are so many booths red? I wonder.
Even though the food was amazing, the place loses stars because of the THREE glasses that came out with lipstick on the rims. Three. I know lipstick is hard to wash off, but if I am paying $50 for dinner (without drinks), I should get clean glasses. For only a dozen patrons, our service for drinks should have been quicker.

Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the ""I wanna put you in my pocket"" line.  
See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was ""Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!""
We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated.
Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!  
One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap.
The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient!
The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty.
The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.  
We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.

It's GeekVille. I mean, I was waiting for my date to show up and heard all about how Batman came to be or something like that. AND I heard people talking about Dungeons and Dragons. (Which was one of the causes for my divorce, but I don't hold it against other people, just my ex-husband.)
There are a bunch of tables outside and two different rooms inside. One is set up like the computer lab in high school. Lots of laptops here!
I love their iced tea. I get it every time. I know it sounds lame to include iced tea in a review, but I like it. I don't get the fancy schmancy flavored kind, either. I'm a purist, I guess.
Staff is super friendly, too. 
You need to ask them for the key to the bathroom, as it's outside, off the patio. They're really clean, too.

I went tonight with Tony A for my first (finally!) visit to St. Francis.  I had first heard about it from Sunny B. and couldn't find it for a week after I read her review.  Duh!   It's right next to my bank!  When Tony suggested we go, I jumped right on that bandwagon!
We had about a 15 minute wait.  The place looked packed, so 15 minutes was fine.  We sat outside and chatted for a bit.  We even talked about how cool it would be if we could sit upstairs.  Guess what?  WE WERE SEATED UPSTAIRS!!   Que milagro!
Our waiter.  *sigh*  I shall hereforth refer to him as Dreamboat Brandon.  (spell check says ""hereforth"" isn't a word.  Is it???)  First of all, anyone who can deal with Tony and I together get major kudos.  We can be...raunchy brats when together.  Dreamboat Brandon rode the wave.  Great service on keeping our drinks filled and not hovering, even though the both of us would have loved that!
I had the ahi sandwich, based on other reviews.  YUMMY!  It came with avocado and tomatoes and what I *think* was a horseradish mayo.  There was a little cup of homemade potato chips on the side.  Nice, thick (no, I'm not talking about Dreamboat Brandon!) steak of ahi on a thick Kasier-type roll.  
The Arnold Palmer was made with mango iced tea, which was totally perfect with my meal.
I love the decor!  Tony said I *had* to check out the bathroom.  Good thing I had to pee.  I couldn't figure out how to open the door to the WOMEN'S restroom and then it opened from inside...by a guy.  He said he couldn't wait.  I gave him the lecture on how WE have to wait in line at concerts and footballs games.  AND he had left the seat up.  Anyway, the bathroom was really funky.  There's even a safe in the wall, which I tried, while peeing, to open.  To no avail.  
All of the staff was friendly and it was just a really cool atmosphere.  It's definitely a place CenPho needed.  I have never seen it empty, even on weeknights.  I am glad that it's so close to home.  I am also glad that they seem to be doing pretty well.  I would hate to see Dreamboat Brandon without a job.  Of course, I do need an assistant...",17,6kmu0mYbdpMIOZ6Y0eVsxg

I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.

He must have been on a date and I felt *really* sorry for the really pretty girl with the foreign accent sitting with him.  His cell rang AND HE ANSWERED IT!  In a restaurant!  his schnoz rivaled Seinfeld's.  He even got angry that their server came by and left because he was on the phone.  She told them it was policy not to disturb.  Fine enough!   Seriously, if I were sitting to eat next to him and not just waiting for take-out, I would have requested another table.  He bugged me THAT much.
It didn't take more than 10 minutes for me to get my food.  Got home, it was still piping hot.  Generous portion of shrimp and TONS of crushed peanuts.  Yummy!  The sauce had a nice sweet/tang to it.  I saved half to eat later.  Or tomorrow, but it was so good, that I will probably eat it later tonight.  It was a little over $10 with tax.

The food was under the headline ""Snacks"" and I was a bit scared of that because I was starving and the prices weren't snack prices.  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Both were excellent.  They use gruyere and fontina cheeses.  The tomato soup tasted fresh and had small basil leaves in it.  It was filling enough for being a ""snack"".
I'm not sure if anyone ordered it, but a bowl of potato chips and two different dips came out after we had eaten.  One of the dips was bleu cheese and DIVINE!
The bathroom?  Blech.  It was very cold...not as in temperature, but it did not go with the rest of the place.  It felt institutional.  Plain, white walls with 8 nails in a row on one wall.  Kind of random, since the nails weren't far enough apart to hang anything on them.

The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos.

I had read the reviews first to see what kind of menu they had.
I opted for the brie and fruit appetizer, along with apricot iced tea.  I'm not HUGE on apricots, but I ended up having my glass refilled twice.  It wasn't too sweet and came with a slice of lemon.  I could have drank a gallon, if not for the fact that I'd be sitting in the theater to see the short films!   What a surprise to have it come - an ENTIRE wheel of brie with some baguette toasts, 2 strawberries and 5 grapes.  Yes, that's all that came with an ENTIRE wheel of brie.  I did ask for extra toasts and got that with no extra charge.  The entree cost $11.  I think that's pretty comparable to going to the market to buy an ENTIRE wheel of brie, fruit, etc.  More fruit would have been nice, though.

They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.  
Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi!
I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original.

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.

I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.

Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.

So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out ""WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.""  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!

I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with ""Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.""  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!

Hahahaha, just kidding. Well, it *is* my 300th, but I'm actually going to write something.
I met my boss here for a dinner meeting. I can walk to this place, but had never been. I know, I'm late to the Vig trend, but when it comes to trendy places, I bush the system somewhat. We needed to find someplace that 
had gluten-free options and a lot of people suggested The Vig Uptown.
It's WAY bigger inside than you'd think at first. Oh, everyone has to valet and it's free. You go in through a huge orange door (I really like orange. I hate yellow, though.) and can pretty much pick a place to sit unless it's really packed. Luckily, it was a Wednesday night and there were quite a few tables available. 
We sat in back next to the bocce ball thing. Is it a court? What would it be called? It's just a long strip of green. Whatever.
The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation. There was a guy playing the guitar. It was pretty impossible to hear half of what my boss was saying. I bet he offered me a million dollar raise & I missed it. Just my luck.
I had the Cobb salad. Holy cripes! The thing was huge!!! Ok, it was $12 but still, I had to take half of it home to eat the next day. Huge chunks of bleu cheese & bacon. There wasn't too much dressing on it, either. I actually like the taste of vegetables and don't like a lot of dressing on my salads.
The service was super friendly and quick to refill drinks.
Oh, and the bathroom is super cool, too. The sink is one of those flat ones that makes you feel like you're going to flood the bathroom when you wash your hands.

You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair.
Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes.
The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long.
Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.  
Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.

We planned on being there by 6, and I was a bit worried. Old Town. Day off for many. New place by Chef Esparza. Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time, as the place started to get pretty busy.
Looking at the menu was a little overwhelming, as there are dozens of different tacos to choose from. Yes, there are other things on the menu, but the tacos are the selling points because of the variety. I brought the menu home with me just to write this review, because we sampled so much ! (It's ok, it's also a take-out place and you can take the menu. I am not a crook. HAHAHA!)
We started with the elote, which you can get in a cup. It was delicious! We polished it off and ended up ordering another one later in the meal.
The tacos we had? The flank steak with an egg (of course), barrio pollo y chorizo, carnitas, cochinita pibil, camaron, and camaron con coco. We also had the green chile tamale. Everything was tasty and wiped out in seconds!
Here's where the final star for the review got taken away: Service. It started out great, but after the first half hour, it seemed as if we were forgotten. It was getting pretty busy, but with a chef who has so much experience, and a grand opening, the staff should have been better prepared.

The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.
Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.
There are NO microwaves here.  I have a ""thing"" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder*

Starving, after being sick for 4 days, I texted Tony A (@lightrailblog) to meet me for breakfast.  We toyed for a few momets, via text, on where to go.  I hadn't tried this place yet.  I used to live across the street from it and waited, with much anticipation, for it to open.  I waited for three months and finally got to go.
Same type of ordering structure as the Beach House and Mushroom Burger places.
I chose the bread pudding, fried pickles and of course a breakfast bowl.  You get 3 scrambled eggs and up to 6 toppings of your choice.  All is served over potatoes.  I chose sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, green onions, roasted garlic and monterey jack cheese.
Our drinks and bread pudding were ready right away, so we dug in.   The bread pudding was really good, moist, and came with a side of icing.  Perfect starter (or dessert) for breakfast!
Our bowls took about 15 minutes.  I knew there would be a wait, because everything was cooked to order.  The place was packed, but at least I had my bread pudding to munch on.  When the dill pickles and bowls were ready, we pigged the F out!  
The toast was butter and chewy.  You could tell it was grilled.  Asked for ranch for my pickles and you could tell it was homemade ranch.  This wasn't Hidden Valley Ranch, no siree bob!
I'm stuffed.  I have the leftovers in my fridge and can't wait to dig in later.
Minus one star for the potatoes.  Not the best; not the worst.  I will definitely be back again, especially since there were hot firemen to stare at during my meal.

Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries. 
Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!!

The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY! 
I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top!

Was I being too picky? Am I expecting too much? Why didn't I love this place? The better question is... Why didn't I even like it?

1)  I don't find the flavor of the brisket to be genuinely smoked. Trust me, my neighbor knows how to smoke meats and fish, and his smoked meats blow this place away.

2) The brisket was lukewarm, not hot. Twice. 

2) It wasn't the experience that you say ""OMG, I LOVE this"". It was just okay.

3) Parking is a pain in the ass unless you're coming south on Scottsdale Road and can park in front of the restaurant...there are only a few parking spaces. IF there was fabulous BBQ inside, I wouldn't mind a walk, but there isn't.

4) Yes, the corn is good. I don't go to a BBQ establishment to eat corn. I go to Iowa to eat corn.

However, the lure of ""salted caramel"" cupcakes was too much to bear, and I ended up trying TopIt Cupcakes.
The storefront is really cute, and clean, and the people that work there are very nice!
There is a little area on the wall where you can ""top it"" if you want to add to your cupcake toppings, as well ( I've never seen that before, but it's a great idea).
Now, for the sugary details. 
I only ordered 2 cupcakes today (down from the normal 6, but I cannot continue to eat like this and fit in my skinny jeans!). Although I have never had a good peanut butter cupcake (usually too greasy) I ordered a peanut butter and jelly cupcake, and of course, salted caramel.
Both of the cupcakes were good in flavor, but the salted caramel could've used more sea salt (just a tad more, mind you). 
The peanut butter and jelly (finally!) was my fave of the day. It was a white cupcake filled with grape jelly with peanut butter frosting (and, a little cookie on top). FINALLY, a cupcake store that got peanut butter right!
Here's the negative on TopIt: Compared to Caketini (the best I've tasted so far) the cupcakes both were a little on the no-so-fresh-in-texture side. Not that the cupcakes were dry, but the tops were a little ""crusty"". I know...picky,picky, picky...
I get that they don't use preservatives, and I am happy for that, but just a tad more on the fresh side would've snagged me for life...or the life of my skinny jeans...
Also, these cupcakes are ""normal"" size, which I personally like better than the biggies at some of the other cupcake stores...
Still, this place has a lot to offer in the cupcake world, and I'll definitely be back on Fridays for Cotton Candy, Malted Milk Ball and whatever I can stuff in my ever-growing tummy.",2,DfJ8B8T1fgNA6_ZT-aeUlQ

Dickey's is a chain, and I don't particularly care for chains. 
Two years ago, we visited the Dickey's up on Shea, and had an immediate adversion to the place. The brisket was tough, the sides were mediocre, and the people that worked there looked like they could've cared less...about anything. 
Today, I visited Dickey's for the second time, but in a new location, close to home. 
I was starving, craving ham, and wanted to check it out, you know...in case I contracted a hangover some day and needed some immediate BBQ relief (this is kind of a joke).
I had the 1 Meat Plate, with ham, and tried the BBQ beans and cole slaw for sides. Pretty good. Better than the other BBQ place I recently reviewed close to home. 
Not as good as Joe's in Gilbert (no where near Joe's perfection) but pretty damned good. 
The line is substantial since their opening a few days ago, and the place is small, but nice personnel that are eager to please, and pretty damned good BBQ...

By ""everyday"" clothes I mean jeans, shorts, and my husbands shirts that are cheap and frankly, gross Aloha shirts. 
Those are the only clothes I will take to this dry cleaner, because if something happens, frankly, I don't care. 
Sometimes, my pants/jeans/shorts are creased down the middle like I want them (and always request them to be done as such). 
Sometimes, they're not. 
Sometimes that uniform looks pretty good. Sometimes, it doesn't. 
I've taken our cotton shirts/blouses in for laundry service, and they looked aweful...
I use their coupons for $1.99 each item, which is the only reason I can justify using this cleaners. They're just not that good...
But, then again, it saves me from ironing...",0,DfJ8B8T1fgNA6_ZT-aeUlQ

Their pastrami is the best in the state, and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real (as in NOT the watery deli stuff you find in most places).

The chicken soups are delish and home made (and wonderful when you are sick with the flu or a cold). 
Needless to say, their bagels are killer.

Their grilled artichokes are to die for, and the pot roast is a must, especially on cold days.

I had the ""mayfair salad"" which the menu states is their version of a caesar salad, and it was the only thing that was palatable. I could not cut the rack of ribs with a steak knife! Hello?! The mashed potatoes were like glue and tasteless. 
My husband had the ribeye steak and said it was average, but he did like his baked potato (it's kind of hard to screw up a baked potato, isn't it?).

We had a party of 7, and 3 people ordered the French Dip Sandwich with fries. Their fries are killer (really thin and yummy), and everyone seemed pleased with the sandwich (at $17 or $18, I wouldn't think of it).
Two in our party had the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad ($16) and I was tickled when I tasted it (still, a salad for $16...NOPE!).
I ordered the Smoked Salmon starter as my entree ($12) and had a side of their braised red cabbage with goat cheese (to-die-for at any cost). The salmon was okay, but I personally think it needs to be smoked a little longer...
All in all, it's a good restaurant with impeccable service.

In addition, there were no signs at the Valley Ho indicating that the event was sold out and people were still attempting to buy tickets at noon (we stayed at the hotel and had breakfast at Cafe ZuZu, which was pretty darned good!).
 
In defense of the event planner, it was the first annual Cupcake Love In.
