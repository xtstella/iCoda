If you read about the event, then you may know I was once an avid bowler in a former life.  Shoes, I owned a pair.  Ball, custom made.  Leagues, I was in several.

Which is why I hate bowling these days.  Huh?

Alleys these days try to be all trendy and crap.  They all look like a Scottsdale lounge with big couches and funky videos playing in the background.   And on any given weekend night you might get ""cosmic"" or ""glow"" bowling with the same thumping music and strobe lights you might find in a Scottsdale lounge!  The most egregious of these types of places is Lucky Strike in Boston (though Kings comes in a close second).  Bleck.  Not to mention they charge like $10 a game.

Which is why Sunset Bowl gets 4 stars.  My perfect alley is straight out of The Big Lebowski.  Complete with broken ball returns, balls that have extra holes drilled in them for no apparent reason, pool tables with ripped up felt, and the original Virtua Fighter arcade game.  $3 for shoes, $2.50 a game, $6 pitchers of beer.  Heaven.  The only way this place would have been better was if they had the old-school desks and overhead projectors to keep your own score.  But I doubt anyone these days is capable of keeping their own score - math is for computers.  Bah!  To their credit, the automatic scoring system would mess up and give/take an extra point on about 25% of the tosses.  Stellar.

There is no point!  Just sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be entertained.  Are you really expecting any sort of intellectual stimulation out of this magazine?  

944 Magazine is the perfect reading material when you're sitting on the toilet pushing one out.  You can go cover to cover in the 5-10 minutes you're on the john, laugh hysterically at points, get depressed over the future of society at other points, and otherwise keep yourself entertained.  And a bonus is that every once in a while you might find an event or new restaurant opening that piques your interest.  

And in the end, it's great for squishing scorpions.

Not to mention IT'S TOTALLY FREE.  I guess if you paid money for it, I can understand a little resentment.  But for a free throw-away?  Give me a break.

944 serves it's purpose perfectly.",4,XeoAojoz5johV2MQ5ngNig

Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.

They cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.

I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.

There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.

The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.

Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said ""if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.""  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. 

Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of ""If we had it, it would be out there.""  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.

Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.",3,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.

I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.

Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.

So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out ""WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.""  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!

I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with ""Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.""  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!

I went on the night of my 21 birthday and thought, finally I get to try this place.  I got 8th street beer and tried 'half' I think its called, its a wheat beer.  I found 8th street to be one of the best beers I had in a while.  I also find that the more local brewery you go to the more likely often have great beer.

I will definitely return when I am in the mood to chill with some friends and have an 8th street or try something new.

Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest). 

The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened ""porch"" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy! 

We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.

We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool) 

So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book.",0,_qQJEA45k_E6EGE7vuzUDA

I come to Sakana on a semi-regular basis for lunch because it is rare that you can find a $10-12 sushi lunch that won't leave you disgusted or with stomach problems later. Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good. 

The fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.

Also try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.

The bar is in front of Nordstrom in the mail and is a rip-off of Starbucks, but a marked improvement. Starbucks coffee/espresso has an acidic and burnt flavor.

 I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of ""classy joints"". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.

The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club ""Next"". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles. 

I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.

For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...

At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service! 

This place is awesome and you can't help but love and support two of the coolest dudes doing some innovative things with food and booze. Go support your local rock stars!",2,vnvTpEzJ8ycSlZy_taxVug

My first time there I was a little thrown off by their system. You don't wait to be seated, you wait in a line to order your food. While in said line they have someone get the number of people in your party, give you a number and then tell you where you're sitting. Once you order your food and pay, you sit at your table and wait for the food to come out. 

I dig eating breakfast here because of their self-service coffee bar. There is no waiting for a server to come refill your mug. Simply get out of your seat, carry your cup over, and then choose from one of 4 different types of joe.

The food I've had here is nothing to die for, but it's well done and presented nicely.

Damn, didn't we just eat In N Out like 3 hours ago? Yeah, but they serve Hot Dogs here. Yea! Okay, so I wasn't helping my diet any, but hey, I'm on vacation. No, not really, but whatever.

One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow, tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions, mustard and JALAPENOS!

My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the ""guys"" made all our food from scratch.

Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect. The price was good, the portions good, the staff were good and the place was clean.
