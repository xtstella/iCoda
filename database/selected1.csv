If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.

As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.

I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.

For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.

We knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered. 

My friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.

We decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the ""Brat Haus"". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal.

My daughter has attended many wonderful birthday parties here. This is a great birthday facility for toddlers - tweens. 

Before you go into the rooms, the kids and adults watch a video about safety on the slides and bounce rooms. One of the rules they emphasize is *getting out of the way* when you get to the bottom of the slide so you don't get hit by the next kid/adult on the slide.

Well, my beautiful girl did not listen carefully, got all spaced out at the bottom of a slide, and slammed by some kid at the party. Next thing I know, she is screaming in my arms  that her arm hurts. The party starts to move into the next bounce room, and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to calm down my screamer and get in the other room so the next party can start in the first bounce room. Every time, I moved, the screaming increased a few decibels. The people that worked there came to assess the situation and help, but I told them proudly that I had it all under control. Then I fainted. 

I woke up in some big man's arms all confused. When you wake up dazed and confused in a stranger's arms, the first thing you do is make sure you have clothes on. Check! Next thing was panic - where is my little girl? When I fainted, the party moved quickly to the other room with all the kids including my screamer, and three parents and two staff members stayed behind to revive me. My husband picked us up and I have been too embarrassed to go back since.

Even though I have to wear a helmet to parties here, I still think it's a great place and highly recommend it! Just make sure your kid is well rested before they get there, and maybe run through some fire drills on quickly getting out of the way.",0,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

I worked at a restaurant with a drive-thru when I was in high school that was run by a tough, whip-wielding family who taught us that you DON'T make mistakes. You just don't. You take steps to ensure that you are not missing anything because no one wants to drive back to bitch when mistakes are made. 

With that said... not only was a special order acknowledged but not followed through, we received no ketchup (for not one but two orders of french fries), no STRAW for a soda, and they charged me an extra 27 cents for a side of sweet and sour. Which they didn't put in the bag. Now while I realize that these are minor items and to some I may be perceived as a petty crank with too much time on my hands, if this is the way you need to drink your soda while you drive, with a straw, it complicates things. If you like ketchup with your fries and at 99% of every other drive-thru in the country you don't have to ask for it, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. And paying extra for something you don't receive is really dumb. 

Onto the food... 
I remember back when I was a young whipper-snapper, that McRib was awesome (as long as you don't lift the bun and look at it, you're golden). While it hasn't shrank like everything else it seems, they now skimp on the sauce in a big way, and let's face it, it's the sauce that makes the sandwich. This sucks: The poor old smooshed-together McRib just isn't that great anymore. Or maybe my cranky, wrinkled-up ornery taste buds have changed. Or maybe I've finally woken up and realized that no one should ever be eating this kind of food, for any reason whatsoever. 
I'm sure it's a combination of the three.",6,Xm8HXE1JHqscXe5BKf0GFQ

The lovely lady that used to make salads has disappeared from the scene, and I am wondering if that is the reason that my Italian Salad doesn't take oh-so-fresh.

We started w/ the sangria-style cocktail - a yummy blend of red wine, brandy and triple sec w/ an orange rind garnish. They were potent and delish! 

For starters, fois gras and mussels. The Fois Gras melted in your mouth like butter and was served w/ grilled peaches and a small piece of grilled bread - it was SO SO GOOD. One of the most wonderful things I have ever  put in my mouth! The mussels were amazing as well, served in a simple thick pernod lemon butter with leeks. They brought us bread so we could enjoy every bit of the broth.

For entrees, we had steak frite and duck confit. The duck was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone with crispy skin and a perfect amount of sauce and vegie medley The steak frite was to-die-for - medium rare was perfectly red - every bite melted in my mouth - it was truly heavenly.

For desert, we had the chocolate creme brulee - it was perfectly caramelized over the entire surface! As a creme brulee connoisseur, I can tell you that nothing is more disappointing than a half-assed caramelized top - this one set a new standard for how creme brulee should be done!

You definitely want to make a reservation for this place - it's a tiny little cozy room with a bar and lots of tiny tables. It was cramped, but I never felt like I didn't have enough space.

""Yeah, we want to order one."" He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said ""no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand."" No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so?

While in said line they have someone get the number of people in your party, give you a number and then tell you where you're sitting. Once you order your food and pay, you sit at your table and wait for the food to come out. 

I dig eating breakfast here because of their self-service coffee bar. There is no waiting for a server to come refill your mug. Simply get out of your seat, carry your cup over, and then choose from one of 4 different types of joe.

The food I've had here is nothing to die for, but it's well done and presented nicely.

Some people also feel it is necessary to keep their dog on a leash even though there are large gates protecting the dogs from escaping. My friends, if your dog does not behave off the leash, it does not belong in a dog park with other dogs. :)

These two issues - dog size and leash/no-leash - exist at dog parks near and far - I just like  to help gently guide those new to the scene.

Also, never wear clothes you love to a dog park.  You may be confused for a lamp post or fire hydrant, and become a conduit for pee-mail.  Watching spaced out dog owners get sniffed and peed on is funny no matter how many times you see it happen.

Bring water for yourself - there is one covered picnic table in each fenced off area. And bring a leash - you have to have your dog on t he leash until you get inside the gated area.  Great park. Big enough for the big dogs to run a lot and get tired.  Because of the separate  yards, little dogs can have fun too.",4,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their ""craft"" beers they are hit or miss.

When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The ""deep dish"" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious!

So you park at the seediest strip mall in Tempe and there are drunk-for-three-days-straight creeps lurking outside next to a pay phone and muttering ""Cheba Hut!"" at you. 
There is a large wall menu inside that lists all of the different sandwiches with different weed names (""Chronic (duh),"" ""Griefo,"" ""Panama Red"").

I belly up to the register and order the ""La Canna"" and the cashier tells me that I can ask one of the sandwich makers down the counter to put my jalapenos on. Okay? Dunno what that's about but hey, I'm new here.
Then we sit at a table and wait like 15 minutes to be called... which is kind of a long time for a sandwich. My name is called and when I go to pick up my sandwich I discover that the 15 minutes is needed to run the sandwich with meat and cheese through the toasting machine. Now they want to know what I want on it. ""Jalapenos, and everything else."" 
""Mayo mustard?""
""Yes.""
""Both?""
""Yes, everything.""
""Lettuce Tomato?""
""Yes, everything.""
""Onion pepper pickle?""
We are both speaking the same language to each other so maybe the word ""everything"" disappears with THC-induced temporary amnesia, who knows. 
The sandwich itself is on some really thick bread that is toasted so the crunchy corners really did a number tearing up my mouth. Also, as my sandwich fell apart I noticed that my prosciutto looked and tasted more like cheap bologna. Yicch.

My favorite room has walls of mazes for a ball to go thru that makes a ton of different noises. So much fun! The third floor has the funnest thing ever!! A huge room full of hanging noodles (swimming pool noodles) - and you can run thru full speed playing tag with your little ones - just keep eyes open for other little ones. I am leaving a lot out (like the toddler room), but just check this place out! It is so so nice! I think one of the coolest things is that the rooms are extremely clean - you never feel like you are picking up a book or toy covered in goobies, which I greatly appreciate. Also, don't go here if you plan to be one of those non-interactive parents. This place requires participation from both parent and child.",2,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint.

You should know that I hate saunas - longest time in a sauna ever was about 30 seconds. But I love a good masochistic workout, so I really wanted to try this.

First of all, about the facility. I have done yoga in many studios and love my classes at the YMCA in Ahwatukee. This yoga studio is so so beautiful! The space is open, inviting, relaxing, and extremely clean. The hot room has ceiling fans, and when it gets too warm, the instructor opens the doors to let cool air in. Even with all the bodies in the room, there was NO stinkiness!! This was always my biggest fear about hot yoga. 

I wore capri yoga pants and a yoga top. I brought a full length towel, huge bottle of water and a yoga mat. The instructor placed me close to the door in case I needed to cool down. The class pace was perfect - flowing from one pose to the next. There was wonderful non-new-agemusic playing on a great sound system the whole time. The posture instructions were clear and easy to follow, however, I think it would be difficult for a beginner. It could be that the instructor knew there were no beginners, and therefore, didn't go slow. I had to stop three times towards the end of the class. I was too hot and my heart was beating too fast. After a three minute break (still in the room) and some water, I could finish with the class. My mat, clothes and towel were completely wet - I'm not talking damp - I mean WET. I highly recommend bringing an extra change of clothes for after class  and wearing as little clothing as respectably possible in the class!

The class costs $16 for an individual session, or $20 for two classes (two weeks in a row). They have a ton of different class purchase plans available with varying discount levels, depending on how many sessions you purchase. I don't see myself doing this regularly, but LOVED the experience and highly recommend this facility!",0,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

We have attended two birthday parties at My Gym, and thrown a birthday party there as well. We had kids at the party ages 1- 6, and all of them had a great time. I would highly recommend this place for parties.

First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful.

The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.

Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory.",0,0d8aK3J6erYIycfoVI259w

The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived (another ten minutes)- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine. The crab and avocado tower had corn inside and gazpacho with it. We had to add salt - it was extremely bland. If you just want to taste avocado and crab, you will love it! If you want extra flava', try something else! The smoked salmon cheesecake was disappointing. A little cute cheesecake that looked smooth on the outside, but crumbled into dry cheese balls on the inside with a very tiny portion of smoked salmon served on the side. House cured smoked salmon is one of my most favorite things - this place will not be remembered for this dish. It was the first time I could describe cured salmon as bland! The one good thing that I would eat again and go back for is the wild mushroom tart. Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish. We never saw our server for most of the meal. If I went back again, I would try one of the big salads I saw at tables around us and that tart again.

I ordered the 20 inch italian - it sounded naughty. :) The roll was fresh and doughy with a slightly crunchy crust. The meat was extremely high grade deli fixings - salami, peppered ham, and some other italian salami, roasted peppers, pickles, and viniagarette. For being a sub sandwich, all three of us enjoyed it fully. BUT, it's not a deli sandwich - it's a sub.

The ambiance is 'cute.' The dining room is a dark, lofty, wine cellar-ish space with a Netflix projection on the back wall. Some tables have couch seating, especially on the patio, though most of the inside tables are wooden along with a few high tables. Like the couple seated next to us, it would be romantic and comfortable for those on a first date. 

We arrived around six PM on Saturday, a good hour before it would start getting any sort of busy. We were a bit disappointed to be seated at one of the uncomfortable wooden seating areas rather than be seated at a couch, but that's not the end of the world. Although, there was some sort of dark, sticky substance stuck under the table. I assumed it was a result of a balsamic vinegar spill but I'm not sure why it would have thickened to the under-table.

After being seated we waited an unusually long time before our waiter introduced himself... by that time we had already decided what we wanted to drink and an app start with. Instead of taking our drink order he let us know that select wines were on sale and that we should look those over for when he comes back, then he rushed back to the kitchen. When he came back we ordered the sangria carafe we'd previously intended to, to which he confirmed, ""just so you know, that isn't on sale."" I hope the service isn't this awkward when it's busy.

The sangria was nice and sweet with a surprising (and maybe a bit out of place) kick of cinnamon. 

We started with bruschetta planks - delicious and creative. For our meal we ordered the Porco pizza - I don't even like pork but it's hearty and shredded addition was undoubtably craveable. 

We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and licked that plate clean -- nuff said! Only before that my partner started to feed me a spoon of the dessert and THAT was when our waiter decided to stop by and see how we were doing. Laughing at the awkward, we were just fine.",0,vTinG2CDMZD2P46Bn4XJvg

The restaurant is small and many of the tables were reserved, so we sat at the bar. From the moment we walked in we had nothing but good service, from being greeted, to our bartender/server, to the bussers, and even another server who had his own tables but was friendly and thanked us for coming in. 
Bread is fresh and warm, mixed drinks are strong, and the caprese salad is awesome - several slices of tomato and soft mozzarella garnished with basil, kalamata olives, and roasted red peppers. 
There were entirely too many fantastic-sounding dishes to choose from. I went with penne pasta with a light gorgonzola cream sauce and sausage, my hot date went with lasagna. Although I could have used a little more gorgonzola kick on my pasta, it was still cooked perfectly and the sauce was clearly homemade, not heavy, and went well with the sausage. I had a few bites of the lasagna as well and the red sauce was pretty good - not too acidic, not too sweet. 
This restaurant also provides a perfect amount of food - not too much that you're going to have a ton of leftovers, but you will be pleasantly full and pricing is appropriate to that - reasonable to inexpensive.
While we ate, we noticed several pizza orders were picked up. More than several. Maybe one every three minutes. I am definetly going to try the pizza next time I come in!",2,Xm8HXE1JHqscXe5BKf0GFQ

While not made with the traditional lamb the slow cooked pork was a good substitute. The Mexican Gyro, seems more a fancy name than an actual depiction of the food you are about to eat. I was half expecting a mexican spiced lamb with a chipotle or spicy yogurt sauce. It's more of a pork Gordita - an upscale taco   with corn salsa and sour cream dressings on a pita instead of corn tortilla.

Im always looking for the best deals around town, and unfortunately, I wouldn't really include this stop as one of them. After dropping $9+ with tax and tip, I was still a bit peckish. A small side salad; or side of any type, would really complete this as a meal.

We were at the youth museum and were looking for a late lunch on a Sunday. This place was open and the yelp reviews looked pretty good! 

Service was excellent! The waiter suggested the seafood enchilada or the Laos combo. We ordered both so we could sample the top picks. The plates are plentiful-  we could have easily shared one and just had a salad with it. Great fresh flavors! The fresh salsa is wonderful - smoky chipotle and not too overly oniony. The seafood enchiladas had halibut and salmon inside and fresh salsa verde over the top. So yummy! The trio/combo plate came with a choice of verde or red sauce - we went for red, which was the spicier variant -it was so good! Beef tenderlion with melty cheese stuffed crispy relleno was to die for! I could eat that every day!! The shrimp enchilada was so good that even the five year old wanted some more. I took the pork tomale home to eat for dinner - couldn't finish my plate! 

They don't have a kids menu, but they do have a nice kids selection the waiter will tell you verbally. Cheese pizza, pasta or quesadilla. I think there were more offerings, but that's all the waiter could say before the 5YO made her selection.

I had the ""killer margarita"" (aka: the house margarita)  and was very happy with the fresh lime flavor. Sometimes, a house margarita just tastes like sweet and sour mix w/ triple sec - this one was refreshing and delish!

I would give it five stars, but there are two things lacking for a five star review: (1) the restaurant ambiance is a little underwhelming - the chairs and tables felt warn/old/cheap and you can't tell it's a great place from the outside decor. (2) food came out warm, not hot. But the flavors were so great that it won't stop us from coming back!

Fri/Sat are really busy here - the waiter said it's a really popular spot for large parties (20-40 people) - I will remember that in case we ever have a large group event!

I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't). 

This place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.

1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.

2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.

3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms. 

4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).

5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try. 

Rumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton.",1,-2gxrMHX8_F1Ep_ppWYTkw

Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest). 

The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened ""porch"" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy! 

We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.

We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool) 

So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book.",0,_qQJEA45k_E6EGE7vuzUDA

I noticed that at the salsa bar they now have a monthly rotation of a new flavor? Is this new or have I not been to a Baja Fresh in quite a while? Anyway, they had this awesome pineapple-onion-cilantro mixture. Sounds weird - tastes FREAKING AWESOME. I could lap up a gallon of that stuff on its own.

Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.

They cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.

I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.

There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.

The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.

Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said ""if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.""  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. 

Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of ""If we had it, it would be out there.""  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.

Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.",3,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

Here, you are seated and then your server explains to you how it works (and very, VERY quickly, I might add... I know the concept is simple but I needed to know why the menu didn't exactly describe the food... and since I've written this review AFTER I've eaten here, I still don't know why the damn menu can't help out with explanations of some of the sauces and spices). 

You are handed a small silver bowl (kinda like a doggy dish... huh.) You walk your lazy ass over to the line and load up on your choice of however much you want of raw chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, scallops, ""krab"" and whatever else is on this chilled salad bar. Playing upchuck-roulette isn't one of my favorite ways to spend an evening but hey, I'll try anything once. 
From here you move on to a stack of different spices (which range from mild to ass-ripping) and while they are labeled, if you don't know what something is to begin with, then you just don't know. I picked three (one was garlic powder and the other two I couldn't tell you) and sprinkled my shrimp/chicken/beef. On to the vegetables!
Here we have what amounts to a salad bar with a few Asian twists. I sometimes think of myself in the same way when I'm gettin' down, and that's only when my ego is in full force. But I digress. You load up veggies into your bowl, such as broccoli, spinach, baby corn, water chestnuts, mushrooms... and I threw in a few of those kung pao hot peppers, just for fun. Then you move down the line to the sauces!
Here's where it gets stupid: There are about 20 different sauces. There are even tasting spoons if you don't know what something is. But my problem with this is that I'm not going to stand here and taste a bunch of stuff and hold up the line (although I am sure plenty of nimrods do). So I just closed my eyes and picked three, just like with the spices. Small scoops into a little dipping container and then you move down to the cook, who will fire up your food with noodles or rice and then have it brought directly to your table. 
I can't tell you what I picked as far as sauces and seasonings go, but the food was cooked perfectly. Beef wasn't chewy and there was a nice sear on the sides of all of the meats. At first, I was disappointed because I couldnt taste any of my flavorings. But then a few minutes went by and I got that steamy, face-reddening, eye-watering aftertaste heat that only Asian food can produce. Great success!
And I didn't get salmonella, either! (this time.)

 I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of ""classy joints"". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.

The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club ""Next"". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles. 

I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.

For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...

At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service!

I have only been to one spa before this in Santa Cruz, so this is not a spa girl gone wild review. 

I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by a nice gentleman with a soothing voice. A woman came over to show me the amenities, provide a locker and the coziest warmest softest bathrobe I have ever worn. Before my massage, I sat in a cozy room with a beautiful adobe fireplace where I listened to peaceful flute music and drank cucumber water. The room was so peaceful that I felt relaxed before I had the massage. There was another woman also waiting in the room, but the place is big enough for two or three to sit and not have to talk to each other. (I personally don't like chit chat before a rub down.) 

I had a 50 minute massage from a lovely gentle giant. He layed hot towels over my back and feet during the massage, and applied perfect pressure. I was in heaven the entire time. 

The pool was closed the day I was there, so I hung out in the hot tub most of the time. There was one in door and one outdoor hot tub. Both of them were lovely. The inside tub could most likely seat about five comfortably. There was a large bowl next to the hot tub filled with iced washcloths to place over your eyes - they had cucumbers in them - really interesting for someone not used to this treatment. (no - I didn't eat them!)

I tried the steam room and the sauna but just am too immature for this stuff. I felt like I couldn't breath in the sauna and I couldn't focus my eyes in the steam room. Both rooms seemed like they would be nice experiences for those who like this sort of thing.

Happy Hour Review: One of the best happy hour offerings I have seen in the valley, but not a huge $$ value. Great food choices that aren't offered on the standard menu. The hours are very limiting, and you can only sit in the extremely small bar area, so you have to be there early to get in on the HH menu. The artichoke dip and the bruschetta were wonderful!!! 

Dinner Review:
We chose outdoor seating under the beautiful trees near the fireplace. It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love! Our server was fantastic and had great suggestions! The mussels were some of the BEST I ever had - they were served in a wonderfully creamy chorizo sauce w/ yummy toasted bread for dipping. For entrees, we had the ahi wellington and the rabbit. The ahi was a little underwhelming - the presentation was gorgeous, but slightly bland. The wasabi mash fondue was just mashed potatoes with an extremely small smidge of wasabi - nothing really fondue or wasabi about it. The rabbit is one of their house specialties - it was absolutely delish! The only downside to the bunny is that it wasn't cooked until it was falling off the bone, which just isn't acceptable for a place like this. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake - it was dense and not very ooh or ahh inspiring - I've had better.

My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food, but something's missing. I expected every plate to be amazing, and was a little let down with the final delivery. I will probably go back again, but it's not my top pick for the money shelled out. I would much rather go back to Chelsae's Kitchen or Cafe Monarch.",1,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

Lately there has been a ton of construction that makes it impossible to get around and the signs for where the terminals are located just dont work. If your looking for which one of the 4 terminals your plane is leaving from you better know before you get there because your not going to find a sign that tells you. Luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system. THough they are now doing some construction to try and fix things (I hope).

Parking is a mess with the spiral parking garages and getting in. The one nice thing is the cell phone waiting lots that are actually really useful and pretty accommodating for a large airport. Parking cheap is just a good distance away on washington and is worth it if you have the time and AAA discounts. 

Inside the airport needs updating but is still better than many of the other airport in the country. Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates. Overall Sky harbor is a low level to middle of the pack airport that is going through some hopefully necessary upgrades but a mess otherwise especially for out of town people.",1,0d8aK3J6erYIycfoVI259w

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.

I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.

Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.

So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out ""WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.""  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!

I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with ""Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.""  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!

Ugh, the food was good, but the two idiot ding dongs behind the counter need retraining and need to learn to not be beotches!!!",4,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

I can say with out hesitation they left nothing to be desired. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable it was easy to pull up to the bar and spend hours talking and enjoying the different offerings.

The food was absolutely perfect, good size portions, the flavors were excellent and at a good value.

We had the popcorn bar snack, the chopped salad, scallops, and the chocolate jar dessert as well as their bread pudding. The only thing I probably won't do again is the popcorn- but I am not typically a popcorn kind of girl. Every aspect of the food and presentation exceeded my expectations.

At checkin, I was asked which room location I would like (all of which came with a balcony!)  - my choices included - pool view, lagoon view, quiet buildings, those located near the party area - so many choices! I was in heaven!! We chose a room overlooking the lagoon - semi close to the pool, but far enough away to have zero noise. At night, there's a fire fountain in the middle of the lagoon that was so wonderful to watch while sitting on the balcony sipping lemon drops and having deep talks.

The amenities were FANTASTIC! There are two water slides that kept us busy w/ the 5YO for hours. There are nice size gates around the pool area and it felt very safe and clean. The adult lounge area was very sleek and beautiful. Next time, we will bring friends so we can hang here and leave the kids with a babysitter at night!  All of the grounds were wonderfully lush and landscaped nicely. I never saw one piece of garbage on the ground anywhere.

The room was lovely - beautiful decor, great materials, no detail was compromised and the place was perfectly clean. Even with the loud fire fountain outside and the ice machine outside our room, our room was completely quiet inside - it was a great experience.

We bought our room with miles, but given the amazing rates, I think we will have to have one more weekend here. 

Here's a link to the great summer rates.

I should have known I was too drunk to be around big fat Greek restaurant waitresses (BFGRW) when the waitress started caressing my arm while I ordered cocktails, and I didn't pull away. That's just a bad start.

We ordered feta and olives and a *small* greek salad. The Feta and olive plate should be called 'feta plate w/ olive garnish' - there were only 8 olives on the entire huge plate. When I tried to articulate this, the BFGRW wanted to sell me more olives! I was too drunk to explain that the plate didn't actually have enough to begin with, so we let it go and didn't order any more. The *small* greek salad was interpreted by the BFGRW as the ""large"" greek salad - she obviously realized she could have her way with us. We also ordered their flight of cocktails - I would not recommend this - it tasted like gummy bears in three flavors.

Then, on one trip, all my friends were busy. They were all at CROSSFIT on party nights! The second time I went home, I started to notice incredible physical changes in my fellow party animals. One guy that had a beer gut was ripped with a six pack and huge guns.  Once again, no one wanted to party because they didn't want to screw up their crossfit routines.  I had to find out what could possibly be better than partying with my friends. That's when I found Tribal Crossfit. 

I saw an ad to try out a session and see if I liked it. Jake and I set up a time, and I met him in the gym - a warehouse/huge garage fitted with free weights, wooden boxes, and bars with long rubber things hanging down. Jake taught me about the importance of good form and basic technique for pushups, squats and pull-ups. He gave suggestions on balance, foot placement, breathing, and I was blown away at how well he could identify my body's weaknesses and strengths. After about half an hour of this, I thought the intro was over and I said ""Thanks"" thinking it was time to leave. Then Jake got a big grin on his face, and said, ""That was the warm up."" I thought he was kidding at first, but quickly realized this was no joke.  He said, ""Most people's work out is our warm up.""  I proceeded to do 25 squats, 12 pushups and 7 pull ups - over and over again. (I don't remember how many times - this was awhile ago.) 

I came home thinking that all my friends back home were nuts. Why would anyone put themselves through this on purpose? I was sore for five days strait and could barely climb stairs or reach the tall cabinets in the kitchen. I decided to wait awhile since the holidays were coming and I wasn't sure how often I would be able to go.

After the holidays, my husband tried it, and became addicted immediately. He was only sore for two days after his first session. I am still a little pissed about that. I joined about two weeks later.

Here's what I love about crossfit: every class is different and a challenge, most sessions have a timed activity which feels wonderfully competitive and pushes you a little further, I leave class feeling completely alive and de-stressed, and now, if I go a couple days without a little muscle pain, I feel the need to workout harder. I haven't been in the class long enough to see huge physical differences yet, but I feel more alive than I ever have in my life.

My friends back home gave some good advice on finding the right crossfit gym, and I am lucky I found Jake at Tribal Crossfit because he meets the criteria. Good form is really important - you want to make sure you have an instructor that is emphasizing good form over increasing weight, or you could get hurt.  Jake knows the human body so well - in the last four weeks, I've had a few aches and pains. As soon as I point them out, he is able to show me how to adjust the move to stop the pain. 

The class is a pricey. But if you think of how much it would cost to have a private trainer three - six hours a week, this is a bargain!

I HIGHLY recommend Tribal Crossfit!",2,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

How can it be that we live in the scorching hot desert and there is only a handful of fro yo possibilities in the area?

I brought in a bunch of stuff for trade, thinking that all my beautiful pieces were exactly what they wanted. They only chose two items that were worn twice! Quality and selection are always the best here. You pay about $2 premium over other resellers, but I like to think of it as a service charge for the work they do to filter out all the ugly used clothes.

The highlight of my meal was the chopped salad. The arugula and other greens were garden fresh and the pesto buttermilk dressing was a great complement.

I also had the roast beef po boy. That plus the salad was way too much food. The sandwich was good-not great. The brown gravy was very light but served to add flavor. The sandwich, like may roast beef sandwiches suffers from the roast beef itself which was a bit dry and flavorless. So the sandwich was a bit disappointing.

However there are a lot of other great looking offerings on the menu that will bring me back. The staff are all friendly and enthusiastic....definitely a place worth visiting.",0,wNqwKWaRjClmcKsoJJRFow

I decided it would be fun to suprise my five year old daughter with a new experience - Benihana's! I talked up the place all the way there - they will cook the food in front of us and do tricks - you won't beleive it! Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food. 

I was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!

Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, ""cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!"" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?

SO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there.",0,0H9ne5frm1GjO6TjUwbxlw

I am a spicy food connoisseur. I like it extra hot  to eye-watering. However:

My throat and stomach are extremely sore right now from the ""spicy"" dishes at this place. Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made ""spicy,"" which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. ""I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA."" Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.

If it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover.",2,Xm8HXE1JHqscXe5BKf0GFQ
