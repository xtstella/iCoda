It is part of the Starwood Hotel Chain, but this is one of their first forays in to the recent boom in Hotel chains opening time share residences for sale under their brands. So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.

But in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. 

It has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. 

You are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. 

This is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.",8,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w

The rooms were impressive, beautifully decorated, and spacious. We especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds, where guests to our fine city of PHOENIX can roast marshmallows. 

The Kierland has some tough competition, considering that the city of PHOENIX has every one of the most famous resorts in the Valley, from the Biltmore, to the Phoenician to the Royal Palms. It does pretty well in a tough line-up. No offense to Scottsdale, which also has some great resorts such as the Four Seasons. It's just that the most famous ones are in PHOENIX.

Of course, it's always nice to find a ride to or from the airport but when you're all out of favors and you have only yourself to rely on, it comes down to driving yourself or getting a taxi.  Sky Harbor Parking to the rescue.  

For $8 a day or cheaper if you print the coupons from their website, the folks at Sky Harbor Parking make it easy to drop your car and get to your gate in no time... and I've used them a handful of times solo and with the BF so I know it's door-to-door consistent service.  

If you are interested in covered parking, call ahead, but otherwise, just drive over to Washington and 40th and they will take care of you from there.  Also, I recommend calling from the airport once you have your bags and they are always good about picking you up within minutes to take you back to your car.

San Francisco, Amelia Island, Atlanta, Buckhead, and Lake Oconee are the ones that stand out.  I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!

When I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).

I will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!  

I took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.

So, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!",5,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw

Sky Harbor used to be my home base for a couple of years. It is a remarkably good airport given the tremendous growth in the Valley of the Sun. 

There are 3 terminals: 
Terminal 2, the smallest and oldest, (United, Continental, others)
Terminal 3, next largest and oldest (Delta, Northwest and many others, including international flights)
Terminal 4, newest and bigger than the others combined, dominated by SouthWest and US AIrways (formerly America West)

For locals, there are the West and East long term parking lots. You can park in the West and walk to Terminal 2; East is much larger with an annex and hi-rise, and closer to terminal 4, but you need to take the shuttles. To help you remember which is east and west, PHX names the shuttles Gecko, RoadRunner, and one other I can't remember! 

For visitors, to get a round the sprawling valley, you need to rent a car. The recently added offsite Rental car Center is huge and well organized into 4 floors with different brands on each floor, and a lot of shuttle buses that are dedicated to each terminal. It is about 1 mile from the airport, but allow 10 minutes for shuttles and loading when you drop off your car. 

They have recently upgraded Terminal 2, expanding the security area and remodeling the restaurant. Terminal 2 has little in the way of food and shops. Terminal 4, organized into 7 separate buildings of gates connected with long hallways and moving sidewalks, has more food and shopping choices, but not on the order of PDX, or DEN. Because of the sheer volume of flights, Term 4 can have a long security check-in line, so plan accordingly. 

If you have questions, there are roaming information assistant volunteers, wearing blue sports coats and hats. Signage is decent and most monitors have been upgraded to flat screens. 

Sky Harbor is located close to Tempe (ASU) and no too far from downtown PHX. The edge of Mesa and Scottsdale are about 5 miles away, but it is 20 or more miles from other parts of North Scottsdale, Deer Valley and North Phoenix. Overall, it is fairly well organized and a clean airport with a lot of flight options, especially on SouthWest or US Airways, who use it as a major hub. For other airlines with a smaller foothold, you have to often connect through LAX, DEN, SLC, ORD or SFO depending on your final destination.",6,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w

I thought it would be fun. I thought it would be cool. I drove by a million times and said to myself, ""I wanna get a room there one of these days."" Unfortunately, when that day arrived I was severely disappointed. 

I knew it was old and I thought that would be part of the charm, but it wasn't. That's the problem. It's just old and crappy, not historic and charming. There is a difference. Maybe it would have been more charming if the staff knew what they were doing. Not a single basic question I asked could be answered by the girl working at the front desk. The vallet guy was NEVER around. NEVER. So that made it a little hard to, you know, vallet my car. The king bed we upgraded to was just two small beds pushed together. Man, I love sleeping in the crack! So comfortable. Want a late checkout, no problem ... oh, wait, problem. The night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages.

Bottom line, someone needs to send their employees to a class on customer service and maybe even give them a print out of their job descriptions. Oh, hey, you know what ... that someone is you, Hotel San Carlos management.

Anyone who doesn't purchase a first class seat might as well expect abysmal service, why let yourself be surprised? 

First of all, US Airways isn't ACTUALLY operating ""US Airways"" style. They're owned and operated by America West, which has always been notorious for nickeling and diming their passengers. Pre-merger, this used to be a somewhat respectable airline. However, as business progressed, America West has inflicted US Air and it's subsidies with ""America West Business"" - overcharging for everything but the seats. (But there's an exception to even that rule...) America West clearly had no idea of the sheer size of the combined new airline they had created. Flights have been continually late, cancelled, and overbooked. Planes are rapidly aging. On US Air Express Jets the America West logo is still quite intact. A lack of business has caused US Air to pull out of hundreds of gates, making airports ghost towns. So don't blame US Air, blame America West. 

Anyway...I've flown both America West & US Air a fair amount. US Air internationally isn't nearly as painful as a domestic flight. Since it's neck  and neck with Southwest, their standards have been mainly homogenized. Except US AIR CHARGES 60 DOLLARS TO CHECK TWO BAGS! Are you kidding me?! No wonder you're going out of business! Southwest cares about it's customers, even if it does pack them in like cattle. As soon as US Air takes the money out of your pocket, the service you paid for is up for grabs- there's no guarantee whether you'll get it or not. Though US Air does offer assigned seating and I do like that a lot. I can't say I'm fond of rushing to the plane to get the best possible seat. 

Flew US Air last night for the hundredth time. Had to fight myself to not buy Almonds...but at $3 they probably weren't worth it. Flight attendants were both friendly and positive. Definitely raised my morale throughout the flight. Flight was a few minutes early, so that was a plus. Things generally run pretty smoothly, at least out of Phoenix anyway. They're definitely doing something right out of Sky Harbor. So I'm not going to complain. It's an airline, they're all the same more or less. It usually gets you where you need to go, and you're not paying $400-$500 dollars like you would on Northwest or United. Take the good with the bad. If you absolutely can't stand lousy service and expensive fees, or you're just looking to get from A to B, there's always another airline to choose from.",1,0KXxuKxlspsO6CrDLgQJ-w

Things I have done at The Clarendon. And I can't list everything because my mother reads my reviews...

Slept in perhaps the most comfortable bed in the world. 
Attended a rockin' Halloween party dressed as, c'mon, guess...Yep...Hello Kitty.
Attended photo shoots.
Had drinks by that glorious pool and waterfall.
Watched the sunset on the fabulous rooftop patio. 
Become a regular (yep, they even know my name!) at Gallo Blanco.
Had dozens of extremely happy out of town visitors stay here. 
Enjoyed the men's urinals shaped like big red lips.
Dried my hands on that amazing Dyson hand dryer (insert hands for 12 seconds and they're drier than a Napa Brut)
Left my beloved bomber jacket at GB and retrieved it the next day...honest, honest employees.

Great staff from hotel to restaurant. Attentive. Friendly. Professional. I want to move somewhere else just so I can go on vacation and stay at The Clarendon. But. Wait. I don't have to. I can simply cross the street from my pad and enjoy this fabulous Phoenix gem.

My colleagues at this event were all from various states, ranging from California to Connecticut to Texas. I was actually the only local yokel. So, in addition to getting a feel for the place during the day, I also collected a number of opinions from people who spent each night at this hotel.

Why?

Why would anyone stay here? The rate one of my colleagues paid was $275 per night. For just a bit more you can stay in one of our fine resorts. The rooms are adequate. The gym was reported to me as being pretty crappy. The only plausible reason for paying that amount is its proximity to Sky Harbor Airport. Personally, if I'm paying $275 (plus tax) a night, I'd probably be willing to shell out an additional $50 for the round-trip cab ride to stay at the Biltmore or something along those lines. One California lawyer I spoke to did exactly that. But to each their own. 

When I discussed this with a local friend, he was also baffled. Apparently the University of Arizona basketball team stays here too, when they come up to play ASU. This, however, I understand. Would you want your 21-year old superathletes to roam around freely on Mill Avenue or in Old Town Scottsdale the night before a big game?

In sum: 

Location = crap.
Price = crap.
Rooms = whatever.

It has old school charm, with adobe inspired architecture. There are 3 golf courses with 18 holes; there are 3 pools, tennis, a conference center, and 3 restaurants. It also has a full Elizabeth Arden Red Door spa,

The rooms are large, probably big enough to fit 8 King size beds side by side in a 2 x 4 format. The bathrooms are also large, with his and her sinks, separate shower cave fully tiled with a seat, large tub (but no jacuzzi spouts), and a walk-in closet. The furniture is large pieces of oak with a darker stain, and the colors are neutral sand and light cactus colors. 

Most rooms have balconies or patios that usually face into the pool areas. The property is well manicured and maintained. 

Wig Wam is a Starwood property (Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, 4 Points) , and part of their higher end Luxury Collection brand. It is also an AAA 4 Diamond resort. However, this time of year (early June), it is very affordable. The conference rate I was attending was less than $100, but even the general best available rate was less than $150. I am sure that high season for snow birds the rates jump to over $300.

As a full service resort, service is very good and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Parking is a little problematic, as you have designated areas and then walking to your room maybe a little distance. Of course they have full valet service, but self-parking is free. 

There are a lot of Spa and Resorts in the Valley of the Sun, literally hundreds of them, like golf courses, too. But if you like old world charm with a southwestern flavor, in a relaxed subdued atmosphere away from the show-off upwardly mobile wanabees of Scottsdale or Phoenix, this is a good choice, especially if you like golf.",9,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w

I've only been to this resort a handful of times, but during my visits, I've spent time at Jade Bar, eaten at Elements, and this past Saturday night, I had the pleasure of attending one of their ""lunch and learn"" events (although in this case it was a ""dinner and learn"" event) in the ballroom. The event I attended is part of an annual summer series which introduces guests and locals to star chefs, wine makers and culinary experts.  The series is sponsored by the guys at EaterAZ, and other partners for the event include Sub-zero, Wolf, Queen Creek Olive Mill, and Fiji water.  It's hosted by Chef Beau MacMillan and this past Saturday's featured guest was Chef Marcus Samuelsson... it was a really unique and fun experience!  Alliance Beverage did wine pairings to go with each delicious course , and local favorite, Dennis Rowland performed with his band.

I have yet to check out the spa at the Sanctuary, but my friends that are members rave about it... and I have yet to spend a night there (hint, hint, Jared... maybe a staycation sometime?), but I do hear fabulous things.  I haven't been to a wedding at Sanctuary, but I've seen pics and they are pretty incredible.

The room was set well with two queen beds and each had four smaller pillows, very much to my liking.

The table with two chairs and one occasional chair suited us well as did the refrigerator. They did have in room coffee but that was the one icky thing, not good coffee. The beds were comfortable and the shower while not overly powerful was ok.

Other guests were an annoyance, but were taken care of by the night desk clerk, well done.

What surprises me about most hotels - motels is the fact of no controlling of noise with insulation and sufficient windows and the huge gaps under the hall doors. This place is no different in these areas.

They do offer a decent breakfast in a nice room with plenty of seating and tables. The woman who does the set up and tear down was very sweet so another plus.

Took the light rail from Van Buren. Got on the train with my bike, and of course there were no more bike racks available. But that's alright, I'm used to riding the BART in the Bay Area with my bike on a packed train. Some crazies around me, but no biggie. I guess in the first car there was an issue with a guy yelling or something, but the Municipal Transit Police took care of it. (I've never seem them before, kudos!)

Anyway, got off at Camelback and Central to transfer to the 39. Super easy. It came right on time, and the driver, who was really awesome showed me how to use the bike rack, since I never had before. But yeah, I've never experienced such a cool driver before. They're usually melancholy or breathing swears out of the corners of their mouths...but she was funny, gregarious, friendly.

Yeah, this review is going to make me sound like a total bitch.  I hope the bride and groom never read this!  I felt like a jerk the whole time because I couldn't shut my brain off.  I just kept thinking about how much it sucked. 

First, I'm not one of those girls who always dreamed of the day she would get married.  I used to carry around a briefcase when I was five and Barbie was always single.  Don't get me wrong, she and Ken had some good times but Barbie always had too many admirers to settle down... including my Prince Charles doll, who always cheated on Diana with Barbie.  I share this because you should know I'm not usually into all the lovey-dovey wedding crap and so this review is probably biased.   

The hotel was under construction, so the bar was closed.  CLOSED!  Oh, the horror.  I had to endure my least favorite part of the ceremony sober.  I hate when the bride and groom use sand as some sort of symbolism that I just don't get.  You know, when they take turns pouring it into a glass and as the sand becomes one so do they... or some crap like that.  

The wedding was held outside in the garden... the garden isn't actually a garden, they just call it that.  I think it could look nice, but I'm a stickler for detail and I had to keep myself from internally nitpicking.  I don't even want to say what bothered me, because like I said earlier, I will look like a real bitch.  I'll just share one thing.  I couldn't help but notice as the bridal party made their way down the aisle that the carpet was taped down with big chunks of uneven tape.  It seemed like such a lazy thing to do in order to keep a piece of carpet down and it looked horrible. I've seen their website, so I know this place can look better than it did.  Just saying, if you're going for the bare bones- save your money and elope.  Do people not do this anymore?! 

I'm not sure where the reception was held.  It was in a separate building across the parking lot.  Like I said, I think this place leaves a lot to be desired if you are planning on just showing up and taking it as is.  Jeeze, I must have been cranky from alcohol deprivation. 

Anyway, some other details for you in case you're looking at the Sheraton for your wedding.  The food wasn't bad and that was a surprise considering everything else.  They will take care of you there. 

In the end, the highlight of the night was the best man's speech.  The bride's family was extremely religious so it made his speech all the more enjoyable.  You see, the groom was a bit of a promiscuous creature and his best man (and brother) decided to talk about his porn collection and the time he caught him jacking off- IN THE FREAKIN' WEDDING TOAST.  One woman actually escorted her children outside in disgust.  It was horrifyingly hilarious.     

So, I'm not sure my review is really going to help anyone, but maybe it will at least give you an idea of what a wedding at the Sheraton Crescent might be like.

This Hyatt Place is in Tempe, a few miles from Sky Harbor Airport (PHX) and close to Arizina State University, a few miles from Downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and close to several freeways to get you elsewhere in the Valley of the Sun. However, it is not a downtown location, so you need to get a car or have someone pick you up. There is a free shuttle to the airport, however. 

One of the best things about this new concept in business hotels is that each room has an HDTV 42 inch LG plasma TV.And the programming has several HD digital channels available. You can also order DirecTV Sports packages for a day in High Def. 

The other great thing about this new hotel brand is that they are actively trying to attract business customers. So if you stay 2 times, you will earn a free night, and get a 2,500 point winter bonus. I have already used this twice, so it is a good deal. 

I got a Fri/Sat weekend rate of only $99/nite, for a plush king size bed with free breakfast, and HDTV. Pretty good deal.",5,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w

Now it's time to write about the blissful and majestic spa on the grounds of the Arizona Biltmore. Oh I could very easily get used to doing a spa day every day. However, until that heavenly day comes, I will be content with doing a relaxing spa day here and there when my pocket books lets me. 

This spa excels in customer service, amenities and services. First of all, the customer service is sublime. They aren't pushy but they are always available. They keep a smile on their face and aim to please without being overly aggressive or coming off sarcastic. The amenities are state of the art. During a spa day, you have access to the tennis courts which are right outside the gym doors, the gym and their equipment that's perfect (especially their treadmills with personal tvs), a jacuzzi, sauna, resort pool and more. You can also partake in a group hike, group bike ride or several other daily activities they offer. 

Now let's talk about the services. I've visited their hair salon and most recently, the actual spa. I got my hair done in the salon for my sister's wedding years ago and they did a fabulous job. On my most recent visit, I got a Swedish massage. During my massage, my massage therapist was amazing and gave me one of the best massages I've had. In addition, she was extremely friendly (but not chatty which I appreciate because I don't like talking during a massage). 

This spa offers specials every month, including a Tranquil Tuesday special where you can get a facial or massage for just $75 on Tuesdays between 2-8 PM. Now you know where I will be during the summer!",6,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

This is despite the fact that it's become a fairly convenient part of my daily routine and regular life in Phoenix, since I live 2 blocks from one of the stations. I like the system and am glad it's here, but it has to improve before I give it more than a mediocre/average 2. 

The downsides:

1. It's slow and will never for any reason ever save me time over driving my car, unless I'm catching some event or football game at ASU given the extra time to find parking and walk. 

2. The irrational, illogical decision to stop running at 11 pm even though it starts running at 4:40 am. This makes no sense at all. The 4:40 start is to catch our early service employees who need to get to work early and I get that. But Metro chooses to serve them while ignoring the late night service crowd, which simultaneously cuts out the late night *consumer* crowd. So it's a double whammy for the local economy: late night workers are shut out, and consumers are forced to leave our local businesses by 10:45. Some will choose not to go out at all since they'd have to either come home early or drink and drive. This hurts our local businesses, and consequently our city and state tax base. 

The upsides:

1. It takes me about 15 seconds to purchase a rail pass at the machines, now that I'm used to them.

2. The station locations are great and were chosen well. The Mill Avenue stop is perfect. The ASU stop can take me from home to the Tempe Improv and back. Same goes for the Sun Devil Stadium stop once football season starts. Most of the Central Ave stops feature either convenient shopping stuff for downtown residents, or nightlife for suburban visitors. There's a stop right in front of Lux for pete's sake! And another at Indian Steele Park (if you're a jogger) or George and Dragon (if you're a beer-drinking slob). One Friday night I'd driven to George to meet friends, had one too many, took the train home, and picked my car up Saturday morning by hopping right back on the train. Perfecto.

3. I've used the train to get from home to Sky Harbor airport twice now. It's awesome. From my front door to the terminal, it is no longer possible to get me there faster than by the train-shuttle system. I refuse to count freebie rides from friends who pick me up, because the friends I have are all perenially late and make me wait. (You know who you are you loveable bastards). To go back home, I just step out onto the curb of the terminal, the shuttle arrives within minutes (I haven't waited more than 4 or 5), it shoots up the road to the 44th St station, and 10 minutes later I'm at home. 

If you ride it often enough, you'll start to get to know the enforcement officers. Most of them are pretty friendly. 

All in all, Metro gets my thumbs up but it's a work in progress and I want to see improvements.",8,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw

The design is modern, with service minimized to the essentials for well seasoned business travellers, like a small bar, breakfast area, 2 room split suite with euro-type decor with male color tones, self check-in kiosks, and 42 inch Plasma TV with HD programs.

This one is a good value, as it is located in OldTown Scottsdale, just a couple of blocks from a large choice of trendy bars and restaurants, and not far from the Scottsdale Art district. 

Most of the Hyatt Places are located east of the Missisippi, and only 3 or 4 in California so far. Starwood has responded with a newer, similar concept, called their ""aLoft"" brand, with the same trendy hip loft like concept.

- Car Rental return lanes through the airport is confusing.  I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people who try to find the car rental return lane have to attempt it at least 2 or 3 times to figure it out.....the directions and route is crazy confusing.  The rental center itself is convenient, and the process of returning your car is efficient, but driving there is a disaster.

- Food options are limited once you go past security.  Not much going on there.

- Gates have insufficient seating.  I don't get it....there's not enough seats at most of the gates.....it's very crowded and people are cramped all over the place.

Hopefully, they can upgrade it soon....it needs it.

We stayed here in October for 5 days, moving from the Scottsdale Fairmont Princess due to a company event. Prior to this becoming a JW Marriot, I stayed here about 10 years ago. Since then they made huge changes in adding a spa, enlarging the pool, making all of the rooms casita's and adding a ton of meeting space as well as a world class restaurant. There's an old town in the back of the property in case you have the need for a ghost-town type of event. Jogging the grounds and the nearby PV nearby neighborhoods is also a wonderful experience. 

The only downside was the check-in experience was horrible. I asked for the manager and it turned out I was talking to him. I'm guessing Marriott didn't train this guy or he just had a bad day. (Service was better at the Fairmont).

Otherwise, a great property in a really convenient location.",2,VqSCQCva71Q-ZVcMsYfQuw

Knowing I had several services, I wanted to wait until it was prime pool weather and I could make it an entire day. So as the weather approached 80, I knew the time had come to book it immediately.  

I arrived bright and early in the morning to be greeted by the friendly staff, a great scent lingering throughout the building and a beautiful pool staring at me from below. After a speedy check-in process, they gave me my itinerary and sent me to the woman's locker room. Upon entering, I was greeted by some more friendly staff who gave me a locker room key and took me on a tour. The locker room is complete with razors, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, mouth wash, hair spray, deodorant, full private showers, a jacuzzi, steam room and two private lounges...and the day is only just beginning! 

Throughout the day, I had a facial, Swedish massage, manicure and blow-out. I scheduled them sporadically so that I was able to enjoy several hours by the pool that overlooks a gorgeous view of Camelback Inn. While lounging by the pool, I munched on a light lunch of a veggie wrap from Sprouts Cafe, the restaurant at the spa. The food was delicious and they list the nutrition next to each item so you have an idea of your intake. Following several hours at the pool, I decided to check out the gym and feel a little productive during the blissful day by working out. The gym is state of the art and each treadmill has a private tv. The staff is constantly cleaning and wiping off the equipment. So now let's go back to the most important part: the services. Each service was spectacular! The facial was relaxing and hydrating and even included a prolonged neck and shoulder massage. The Swedish massage was so heavenly it put me to sleep...in a good way. The blow-out left me feeling like a celebrity (and included a scalp massage) and the manicure made my nails weekend-ready (and included a hand massage). I've never gotten so many massages in one period of time! 

The thing I like most about this spa is that it's relaxing and if you plan it right, you can make it a complete eight hour day here and make the most of the spa. I could get used to having days where I float on cloud nine like this, but in the meantime, I will just always remember my heavenly day at the Camelback Inn Spa.",9,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

I've ridden it to do grocery shopping, go to dinner, go drinking, celebrate my birthday, hell just about everything. My truck has been driven once since the first day of service, and I've ridden my motorcycle maybe 4 times.... its been 9 days folks. 

This thing changed my daily routine for the better. I understand I could have done the same thing with a bus, but the bus only ran every 30 minutes and took forever and was uncomfortable and was so small if there was a smelly bum you couldn't get away from him. The train has changed it all for me. 

What's keeping it from 5 stars? The same thing that everyone else is complaining about, the running hours. I'd love to not have to leave the bars at 10:40 to get a ride home. It's also very inefficient running through the city. I can get from the 12th street station to Mill Avenue in 16 minutes which is about 11 miles.

First jab at the religious folks. We spent the afternoon poolside drinking mojitos, pina coladas, and Dos XX. Anytime the swarm of God's children splashed or came to us in the pool, we chanted ""Too closey, no splashy."" They did some sort of sign of the cross thing and off they swam. Jab number two.

You truly feel his spirit here at the Biltmore. Especially after boozing it up in the afternoon sun. As we sat in the spa today, awaiting our masseuses, we noticed front page news in the AZ Republic, announcing a $300 million Biltmore renovation. And. Well. It's a good thing. Cracked paint. Buckled ceilings and dated furniture. Though badly needed. Did not mar the ambiance, energy and joy we experienced for our retreat.

There was no space outside for sitting other than a chair next to the room beside us. Yes it was nice, but only to a point. That point dropped when I found out how much she paid for this room, I almost pooped my pants. I am accustomed to paying silly prices for rooms as I like nice.

Where's Terminal #1? Ok, so the airport has 3 major terminals---since I've flown Alaska/Delta/Southwest in the past year, I have arrived at Terminals 2,3, 4, respectively. One day I stopped to gaze at the map noticing there is no Terminal 1. Hmmm, this is odd. (Footnote: T1 was demolished in 1991 per the web site.)

How many of my friends met their significant other/spouse in Sky Harbor? Answer is 2. I can't tell folks of any airport other than Sky Harbor where this has happened.

How much time do I need to allocate for a rental pickup/return? Well, it depends on time of day and day of the week; but, 20-30 minutes is a bare minimum. I know there's a Sky Harbor train somewhere, but it's not connected to the rental cars.

Who runs the airport? Oddly, the City of Phoenix v some airport commission.

Are the Southwest terminals (Doors A,B, C and D) connected after going through the TSA line? Yes!....an undocumented feature is Terminal #4 is shaped like an inverse letter ""c"" in terms of layout. I suggest you enter semi-close to your flight, but if the line is crazy, simply switch entrances. A to D is the longest walk, but there are moving sidewalks.

There's free wifi and lot's of choices on food and drink. I've only been stuck here when it was too hot for planes to leave due to lack of lift and during the occasional thunderstorm. (Re-fueling isn't a great move.)

Knocking on wood as I type this: I've had no major issues with flying US Air... I'm a big fan and will continue to give you my business.  Please just keep the complimentary upgrades and VIP treatment coming - I kind of like feeling like a princess when I travel!",10,fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw

It is on a one-way frontage road, so you have to come from the north of Northern Avenue and slide down the frontage road to get to it. It is on hotel row for this area, just a mile form the Metro Center, and a bunch other hotels on eaither side of the freeway. 

It is a typical Residence Inn. It is a group of about 20 low rise 2 story buildings. Parking is adequate and nearby your door. 

Inside, this member of the Marriott chain is known as an extended stay type hotel, with a 2 room suite, which includes about 600 sq ft of space. There is a full kitchen, with 4 burner stove, full fridge, microwave and dishwasher, all in new stainless steel, with marble counter tops and a wood/linoleum floor. Full dishes, glasses and utenzils are available like home. 

This one is pretty new, with clean, unstained furniture in fresh condition. There are also not 1, but 2 black 42 inch LG flat screen TVs., one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The living room has a desk, 2 seat dining table, a lounge chair and a small sofa with sofa bed. There is a door between the rooms, so if you wanted to have the kids along, you can still keep your sanity in the other room.

Depending on time of year, this R.I. is a good value, costing about $100/night, which includes a free breakfast, evening hospitality hour, free Wi-FI internet, and free parking. 

This little one bedroom, if it was a condo near downtown San Francisco, would be a million dollars!

Now that the Light Rail has been in operation for a couple of years, I can say that it's definitely not perfect but I will say that it's better than what we had before which was ... a bus and taxi system. 

The Light Rail provides hope to Downtown Phoenix. When I'm in Downtown Phoenix, this is an excellent option to get me from point a to point b. If I am coming from Mill and want to get to Central all I have to do is hop in the Light Rail. But what about when I'm in Scottsdale and want to take the Light Rail to Downtown Phoenix? Sadly, that does not exist my friends. Unfortunately the Light Rail does a great job of getting someone from Central and Camelback to Mill Avenue, but not from Mill Avenue to North Scottsdale...or even Glendale or Old Town. 

I like the Light Rail. I think it provides great transportation and I've compromised with its lack of drop-off points by doing things like driving my car to Mill to take the Light Rail to a game downtown. The Light Rail is cheap and yes, it can be shady but that's half the character of public transportation. However, I honestly don't benefit from the Light Rail very much since it doesn't go north and south or even to places like The University of Phoenix stadium. I have my hopes that we are just experiencing phase one of the Light Rail and that the city has it in their plans to expand it so that it truly becomes a helpful transportation resource in the Valley and one that might end the issues involving drunk driving, smog and clogged roads. If we had a Light Rail that covered the entire Valley like BART covers nearly the entire Bay Area, we would see thriving change to different parts of the Valley and especially areas like Downtown Phoenix. I know I would spend even more time down there if I could hop on the Light Rail in Old Town on a Saturday and ride through the Valley on the Rail rather than driving my car.",4,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

It's within 10 to 15 minutes driving distance from probably over a million people in the Valley. 5 minutes from downtown Phx. 10 minutes from downtown Tempe. 15 minutes from Ahwatukee. Granted, our kick-ass highway system plays a role in that convenience. But convenient it is, unlike most airports of similar or larger sized cities.

In 12 months you'll be able to park in your suburb or have someone drive 5 minutes to the closest light rail stop, and the Metro will take you straight to Sky Harbor. (To be accurate, it'll take you to one last shuttle stop, and a shuttle will pick you up and take you to Sky Harbor; a direct connection is being constructed for the future). 

The terminals generally suck except for Terminal 4, which is okay. I can remember at least 2 occasions when I got drunk-dialed by friends from Terminal 4. Each time they were passing through Phoenix with no intention of letting me know, had some extra time, sidled up to one of the Terminal 4 bars, and *BAM* they were sloshed on bloody marys and suddenly wanted to catch up with yours truly. 

Thumbs up on the free wifi. 

The hourly parking garages are comfortably close to the terminals with minimal walking involved. The long-term lots are more of a pain in the ass to deal with but that's the nature of the beast. They do have air-conditioned lobbies and garage parking though. 

Granted, it may be because I'm a local and am so familiar with Sky Harbor, but the most important reason I like it is the speed and efficiency with which I can (a) drive in, pick up a passenger, and drive out, and (b) get off a plane, pick up my baggage, and step outside to the curb to be picked up. (Most likely by one friend in particular who is incapable of showing up on time, so that screws it all up, but that's not Sky Harbor's fault.

In addition, they have every amenity one would expect and more.

Our casita # was 282 in case anyone wants to put in a special request ;)  It's located near the Golden Door Spa which I'll review separately but highly recommend!

During the 24 hours we spent at The Boulders, we sat by the main pool, had some lunch, visited the spa, Jared played a bit of golf (I hear the course is pretty spectacular), saw a coyote, worked out in the top notch fitness center and movement studio, had a glorious breakfast at the Spa Cafe, and were blown away by the friendly staff / service all around.  

The Boulders truly provides a Zen-like experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing get-away in a first class resort.  I will warn you, it's pricey in high season.  Thankfully, we did have a gift card this time... but I can't wait to return and take advantage of their summer rates (which I hear are pretty incredible).

I ate at the the high end Mex restaurant on property which was good, not great, and had good to excellent service.  Being by the parking lot I self parked which was convenient.

Now I can read and because I can I know that the name is officially the ""Crowne Plaza San Marcos Golf Resort"". But to all of us Arizona long-timers, it's just the San Marcos. It has a nicer ring to it anyway. 

Dr. Alexander J. Chandler (the city's namesake) built the San Marcos in May 1912, just after Arizona was added as the 48th state. The resort is a prime example of Mission Revival architecture. It features lush, well-maintained grounds and a lovely courtyard and fountain. And even though the resort sits right off Chandler's main drive, once you are inside the grounds you feel a million miles away. 

The lobby of the San Marcos is graciously decorated with hardwood floors, leather seating and decorative wrought iron. They also have a lot of antique photographs from Chandler's by-gone days which I found interesting. The staff were all attentive and smiled a lot, without being annoying. The room we had was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Our room also had a lovely balcony, and I was told all rooms either have one or if on the ground floor, their own patio.

On the negative side the place is in kind of a bad area. Not a lot of good local dinning options although I did find the De la Cruz Bistro to be very good. Sport bar across the street is what it is.

I got a great summer rate, $99, for a good size room on the 18 floor. 

When it is 115 degrees in downtown Phoenix, where this hotel is situated, it is like a science fiction movie where everyone in the middle of downtown is gone. Nobody walking the streets. Everyone left town. 

Ergo, the great rate, whereas in the winter, the same room may go for $250. 

In summertime, there is only one person working the registration desk. They have kiosk check-in stations, and she shows you how to do it. You can check out the same way. 

Valet parking ($27) is not automated, however, and tips are still expected. 

Free WiFi if you are a Hyatt Gold Member.

PS - best thing about this hotel is that they put your soap and shampoo, both new, IN your shower, on the little platform. Makes sense, doesn't it?

Constructed in 1929 by a former employee of Frank Lloyd Wright (his draftsman) Albert Chase Mcarthur, it is an architectural masterpiece.  Everything about the design is unique, and awe inspiring.

What is not so inspiring is the condition in which the hotel sits in today. The place is literally falling apart at the seams. Be prepared when you visit for a lack of AC in common areas, rooms in a state of disrepair and need of remodel, and as of 10/17/08, a LOT of construction. The Villas on property are privately owned, which roughly translated means that it is the owners responsibility to keep them maintained, not the hotels. You don't know what you are going to get. 

The 39 acres of grounds on this property are stunning. Kudos to the grounds crew as the grass, trees, and flowers are always perfect. 8 pools across the property are beautiful and with the exception of one, are open 24 hours a day. They also have 7 tennis courts and full size basketball court outdoors which is nice. 

Wright's is a great dining room, and I give it my full endorsement, but their other options are uh, how do you say, crap? The Cafe is very overpriced and never open when it is supposed to be. Cabana Club is good, but has no indoor seating so it only works in the cooler months, and closes at about 4-6pm daily. The Biltmore Grill is closed for construction for the forseeable future. 

I'm just really mixed on the place, I want to like it so bad, but the fact of the matter is you can really tell there is no pride of ownership. Morgan Stanley owns the hotel, and what can I say? They are an investment firm who reads the profit margin on their statement every month and is long as it is a black number, they ignore the place. If you want to go somewhere that really cares about your business, this is probably the wrong place. If you are into architecture and history, check it out.",6,JgDkCER12uiv4lbpmkZ9VA

From the minute I enter until the minute I leave, I feel like I'm in pleasantville. Everything about DC Ranch is clean, cute and comfortable. From the houses to the market street, everything is top notch. 

Over the years, DC Ranch has taken a little turn. What started as the all-in-one community equipped with nightlife, day-life and living essentials, has transformed into more of a community without so much of the nightlife -- and I think that's a good thing. 

I will begin with Market Street. This is the area that has transformed over the years and with it, the nightlife style bars have vanished. I think this has allowed DC Ranch to turn into more of a homey community rather than the next Old Town. Several restaurants still line the streets, and very popular ones at that. On of my favorite wine bars is still there and there are several boutique retail stores. It's a nice shopping area to walk around on a weekend. 

Now moving on to DC ranch, the community. The houses in DC Ranch are like little castles. The architecture is pretty and the houses are private and in a community at the same time. Within the community, residents have a ""club"" equipped with a pool, playground, tennis courts and community area. This is perfect for families and makes it a community with real neighbors. Each section is behind gates as well. 

I think that DC Ranch is a great option for a family with small children who want to live in a safe and enclosed area.",4,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

Our room had about a 20 foot ceiling with skylights, a patio which opened out to a semi-private hot tub, and a gas fireplace.

The bathroom the size of most bedrooms with a seperate room for the toilet, huge soaking bathroom, double sinks, and HUGE shower with dual showerheads. 

The grounds are gorgeous and very well manicured. This property is lush with lots of trees and grass, and is a beautiful respite from the desert surrounding it.

First up, I love the corporate air carrier area! The planes are really cool and I like the classic ones that you can view while you visit. The airport is extremely intimate and only houses relatively small planes, but it's similar to an old school airport and one where you can almost feel like 1960's celebrities will get off the private jet. This would be a cool place to bring children and let them watch the planes fly in and out.

The room interior was underwhelming. The bathroom was shockingly crappy-looking. The tub looked old. 

The lobby looks interesting enough. For 5 seconds it kind of looks like it will meet up to its promised allure. But reality sets in when you look a little closer. The Mondrian is worth spending the time to walk around exploring it. It's not worth paying money to sleep in.

There is nothing bad about DC Ranch- it is a pretty little center in an upscale neighborhood, but it has nothing special enough about it to draw my patronage now that I have moved!

That said, if you live in the area it is extremely convenient and has some good restaurants and a relaxed desert atmosphere.  Have a sip at the Armitage wine bar, enjoy some creative sushi at Blue Wasabi, get decent (not going to blow your socks off, but will satisfy your craving) Mexican food at San Felipe, buy some pretty flowers for your lady at the Bloom Room, get groovy with live music in the bar at Eddie V's, and attend the family oriented events at DC if you're apart of the NoSco community.

While the resort is a bit much on the southwestern decor, and it's really spread out, it's situated right next to Pinnacle Peak and it is quiet and gorgeous with fantastic customer service.  But - you'll pay for it!  We treated ourselves to a night here and we're balancing it out with a night of camping tonight.  Quite the contrast, i know.  Next time I'd do it in reverse order.  Either way, it's a treat!

If you are looking to get away and just want to stay on site at the resort, this is a fantastic option.  Fun bar, beautiful sites for outdoor weddings, big ballrooms, nice rooms, etc... it's close to Greasewood Flat, but that's about it!

We're off to spend some time at the pool now - I may try to stop in for a quick workout in the fitness center on my way there.  4.5 stars for my experience here so far - a wonderful option for a vacation or staycation depending on where you're coming from.  Enjoy!

My favorite thing about Gainey Ranch is that some sections of the pool are adults only with swim-up bars, but unfortunately it doesn't include the fake beach which is always so packed with kids it is almost impossible to enjoy.  That is my only problem with this pool, I have never been able to lounge on the fake beach because every square inch is covered with kids and crying babies.

I have flown 4 times with US Airways over the past two years and not one of my trips didn't have some kind of delay.

I was delayed for almost 6-hours coming back from San Francisco, and over three hours from Phoenix to Vegas (I could have driven quicker than the total one way trip time of 5hrs). What gets me is their lack of communication - It's like a complete mystery to them when the flight will actually take off...

All airlines seem to be having major difficulties being on time lately... Why is this such an issue in the last few years? I would gladly pay an additional $25 per flight to be SURE that it would be on time - wouldn't that motivate airlines to step up their game?

The Fairmont Princess has three pools, well two and one with a slide.

The South pool is for adults or at least less kid friendly.  There's club music, lounges, beds, and various raft/inner tube floating devices.  The beds are the best and I totally scoped one out as soon as I could.

The East pool is kid friendly and plays more island type music.  The slide is located directly behind it.  

Back to the South pool...

I was sitting with my friend by the jacuzzi waterfall when these guys tried to pick up on two ladies dangling their feet in the water by the stairs.  They asked these ladies what brought them to Scottsdale and they answered... rehab.  No joke.  It was hilarious.  They had just graduated the program and were celebrating by the pool.  That will be my new line whenever someone asks if I am from here.  I will say, ""Nope, just here for rehab.""",1,rjlb-7-JcmM6fR64ZpyTug

It can be spendy (very) although recently they have been getting more price aggressive here. 
Rooms can be small and dark. I stayed in one of the newly remodeled ""Spa suites"" and would NOT recommend for the money. We never even used the living room area because of its unusual lay out. The balcony was very small as well, most appeared to be that way.

It is the Four Seasons after all and they pride themselves in being the best of the best. However, I am really giving this Four Seasons five stars because they go above and beyond with the little perks that really make them stand apart from the rest. 

I haven't had the pleasure of staying at this resort, but I spent the day using the amenities and all I can say is, wow! I arrived early for my spa day and once I checked into the spa and poured myself a glass of the strawberry infused water, we made our way out to the tennis courts to play a little bit before the treatments. The courts are made of grass and definitely made me feel like I was playing in Wimbledon! 

Talavera was under construction and since the spa sits underneath the restaurant, they moved the treatment rooms to suites throughout the property. Four Seasons...you get a big bravo on your strategic placement of the treatment rooms! The check-in room was in one of their amazing casitas. I had no idea their casitas looked like this! A one bedroom has two bathrooms, an outdoor private shower and a private patio with a fire place and a private pool. Yes a private pool! I will dream about this casita. 

The spa treatment was incredible. They were offering a ""happy hour"" deal with two 25 minute treatments, so I opted for the Swedish massage and a foot massage. It was incredible and I nearly fell asleep! As if that wasn't good enough, once the massage was over, they offered me a chocolate covered strawberry to enjoy on my way out. This is an example of a little perk that goes a really long way! 

After the spa treatment, we made our way out to the pool for an afternoon of fun in the sun. They have a total of three pools, including an adult pool, main pool and kid pool. It's nestled in the mountains and the view is spectacular. In addition, the cabanas are free! That's right, they don't charge for the use of their basic cabanas so you can get the shade without the additional cost (if you want a cabana with a TV, etc that will cost you). While we enjoyed the sun, a pool girl came around every 20 minutes with a different complimentary nibble! The first time she brought pineapple, the second time around she brought out cups of corn nuts and the third time around, she brought out rice krispie treats with peanut butter. Sadly, we missed about three more rounds. This is another example of small perks going a really long way. 

After my staycation day at the Four Seasons, I have absolutely added this resort to my list of must-visits.",9,4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ

Luckily, this store allowed me to stay within my budget and walk away with a nice (and really cute... I am a girl after all) pair of Nike golf shoes. They were on major clearance at around 40-50% off. Perfect for what I was looking for! Plus, when I graduate from not being a golfer to being a golfer, I will revisit this store for some new golf clothes and accessories such as a Wilbur the U of A Wildcat golf head cover!

we took one of the short tours describing evoo and all that goes into it and actually learned a few things. there was free wine tasting so of course we took advantage of that. 

we had eaten before we made the arduous journey through apache junction into the wastelands of queen creek just in case we broke down, we could outrun the methheads on a full stomach. 

there is a food court there with what looked like severely appetizing food and many racks of locally pressed olive oil, coffee, and wine. we arrived early, which was a GREAT thing because around 10:30 am, the place was packed with the elderly and overweight soccer moms ingnoring screaming and ill-behaved kids. even several large ""senior/church"" groups. soon enough, we had to high tail it out of there.

Since the property is large and offers various entrances from the parking lot, I don't recommend valet parking as it is more convenient to park your car near the entrance to the door closest to your room.

One of the great things about this hotel is that it has a Fleming's on property.  We enjoy Fleming's Steaks, so that's always a big plus in our book.

I highly recommend that friends consider staying here when visiting the Scottsdale area.  It's located on Scottsdale Rd, a short distance to Old Town where all of the eats and fun places are.

I've been traveling so much lately, that I'm way overdue in writing this review of Phoenix Sky Harbor. I admit, it's a tough one to write though... your experience relies 100% on the airline you're flying, what terminal you're at, and TSA / security.  Of course, it's always nicer when you fly first class or club member level, as you typically get to avoid major lines.

Luckily, I live only about 20 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor aka PHX.  My favorite terminal is terminal four; it's the newest, easiest to drop-off / pick-up from, it has the most dining options, etc... 

I find the staff at the airport to be friendly overall.  It is easy to navigate through, and we've got clean restrooms and free wifi too (if you're lucky enough to get it to work for you); but there's nothing else that stands out about this airport to make it so unique.  (No really local businesses with a presence in the airport, no extraordinary food vendors, no rocking chairs, etc... and for that reason, I'm giving it a three star rating - A-OK indeed!

I have no knowledge about it and can't appreciate it when I see it, unless you count my pointing at a building while saying, ""That's pretty!"" as ""appreciation"".

A few months ago I attended a seminar at the Biltmore. About an hour into it, I leaned over to a friend sitting next to me and whispered that the conference room we were in was ""really cool"". Not sure why, not sure how, but somehow my diminished-capacity brain for architecture detected something, I guess, extraordinarily ""pretty"". Some time later, and I swear this is true and I'm not making it up, another equally diminished-capacity friend (we're all lawyers, 'nuff said) sitting on my other side leaned over to tell me, ""Hey, this room is pretty amazing isn't it?"" He hadn't heard me say anything to my other friend. The room was so amazing that even two architecture morons' dog-like instincts for pretty buildings were setting off alarm bells in their thick skulls, completely independent of each other. 

Only after we finished the seminar did we learn that the conference room was, of course, designed by the late, great Frank Lloyd Wright circa 1929. I am unable to explain the intangible details of why it was so incredible, other than to say that while sitting inside it, everything felt perfectly balanced, perfectly in tune, and perfectly pretty.

I've been to the Biltmore on other occasions, to meet friends at the bar for a drink, and to have tea with guests who were staying there. So I've experienced as much of it as one can without ever actually spending a full night there. It is fabulous. And very pretty.",3,17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw

I noticed a few things I really liked, and MANY that would keep me from ever recommending someone to stay here. 

1. The pool area has obviously had some thought go into decorating, and they pay respect to the city with a giant Phoenix bird sculpture, awesome!

2. They have art all over from different parts of Arizona, as well as Arizona license plates on the rooms and directional signs. I love the sense of pride for where we are from.

That's about all the good qualities we could find. . . the bad....:

1. The windows on the outside of a building are those from a disgusting slum of an apartment building. It's obvious you took a shortcut and couldn't spend the money to finish the remodel.

2. You have disgusting stairs, carpets, and rails on all the outdoor common areas. Again, did you want to finish this remodel?

3. The hallways we walked through at the end of the building smelled like puke, and had worn out carpet along with thick coats of paint that appeared to be centimeters thick. Did you strip the walls before you started the remodel? The smell of vomit went away as soon as the smell of marijuana from someones room took over.

4. Your elevator buttons don't light up, and the elevator is scary with stained carpet. I felt like I was picking up an STD just standing in it.

This place feels like a Daytona Beach spring break hotel from the 90's or perhaps one of the trendier hotels in Rocky Point. It feels like a third world attempt to be upscale, and it's obvious that someone wanted to half-ass their way through a remodel. Not to mention the fact that I've watched the owner go on various chat boards and forums across the internet only to talk shit about every property in town that is worlds nicer than his. I hope that anyone who stays here is used to Motel 6, enjoys watching people making out in halls, and likes thumping techno, because that is the only way they will be impressed. 

This place is like third world spring break 24/7, and I'm pretty sure the ""bar"" on their rooftop is actually a folding Costco card table.",7,JgDkCER12uiv4lbpmkZ9VA

Do you want the perfect place to stay in the Valley of the Sun while your team is playing against Sparky at ASU?

Try the Aloft. It's decor is like a hip, trendy, bachelors pad, and their lobby is like a bottle service club or lounge (without the bottle service).
It is brand new, just opening in February 2009. 

Here, when you get hungry, you can go across the street to Inn-n-Out Burger, and after that, go to YogurtLand for Fro-Yo, and what more could you want? Yes, there's a Starbucks within a 1 minute walk. 

Oh, it is only 1 mile from campus and the Stadium, and close to the Phoenix airport. 

Aloft is not your father's business hotel. It is designed for the younger, hipper, going-on-my-first-years-of-business-trips-crowd. 

The rooms are like a city studio dwelling in design; Euro efficiency in space, trendy decor and colors like that modern furniture store in that trendy city neighborhood you hang out in. 

But be careful, there is no real closet or dresser. Just cubby holes, a curtain to cover your clothes, but no real drawers to hide your drawers!

If you have friends visiting, hide your unmentionables in your suitcase. Oh, and the door opens right into the bathroom sink, so when you are nude, brushing your teeth after a shower after 8am, try the deadbolt and lock so the maid doesn't walk in on you butt naked! (Unless she is cute and you're an exhibitionist!) 

The gym is nice with all new machines, the pool area is like a fancy desert party pad, and the lobby common bar area is like a Vegas lounge, with the bar as the main feature, 4 small TV screens, and a pool table to shoot around on. 

Aloft is exactly like Elements, the other new hip, trendy chain from Starwood.. Aloft is the new younger demo chain for W Hotels, and Elements is almost exactly the same and is the younger., hipper chain for Westin. They are all owned by Starwood hotels, ergo the similarities. 

But don't expect food. They have snacks, like 7 Eleven or Egg McMuffins; and they offer a free hot drink for Gold and Platinum Starwood frequent guests. Big whoop! (They do have a self serve latte machine). They do offer free WI-Fi though, and free parking here. Neon lights on the sides of the building, too. No charge. Haagan Daz for late nite snacks, too. 

Pricing is reasonable, in the $100 - $150 range, depending on season, location and availability. Most Alofts are in the east. So far there is only one in California and 2 in Arizona.",7,2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w

I must still state that most of the yelp reviews here are way over rated. Look this isn't a horrible place but certainly not 5 star as multiple previous reviewers have posted (IMHO). 

Positive: Pools and grounds are beautiful. Yelp photos don't do it justice. Restaurant was way better on recent stay. Food was excellent. Room service was prompt. Staff is friendly. 

Negatives: I still contend it is pricey especially off season. Again, the Four Season's in North Scottsdale was actually cheaper but less convenient for me so I stayed at the FS. There is no comparing the two hotels (see my review of 4 Season). I don't care for newly decorated rooms. To be honest I preferred the old look. The exercise room is a joke. No locker room, sauna, or steam.  Half the rooms face a parking lot which can get noisy. Denied me a late check out after staying there 5 days.

The service at Hyatt Gainey was top notch from the bell men to the reception, the barista at the coffee stand, the servers in the restaurant  and at the pool, and of course at the spa.  The room we stayed in was spacious and perfect for our group.  We had four girls on Friday and planned for five on Saturday... I  know you're thinking that there's no way that many girls could share one bathroom and you're right - we used the spa to shower and get ready instead of the room!
