I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.

There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.

The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.

Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said ""if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.""  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. 

Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of ""If we had it, it would be out there.""  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.

Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.",3,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

I love everything about them, and last night was no exception. It was Friday night and I was hungry!!!

But, of all the port of subs, this ones open nice and late.  9PM during the week!!!  In other port of subs reviews, I have openly complained about the horrible hours that the hold, such as closing early (like 6PM on week nights) and some are closed on sundays....others close at 4PM on Saturdays.  Really? lunch only? you can't do like 7PM?  So this one's my favorite just due to the hours alone.

I came here with my friend after hitting up a few other places. It's located right next to Lowe's in a little strip mall.  I went with the turkey and pastrami 5 inch sub as I always did, and really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly, and food was prepared quickly.

I will be back, and enjoy myself every time I'm here!",3,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.

I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.

Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.

So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out ""WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.""  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!

I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with ""Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.""  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!

Ugh, the food was good, but the two idiot ding dongs behind the counter need retraining and need to learn to not be beotches!!!",4,JffajLV-Dnn-eGYgdXDxFg

Service was extremely good.  

So why 3 stars.  I could easily have put 4 stars.

I also had the roast beef po boy. That plus the salad was way too much food. The sandwich was good-not great. The brown gravy was very light but served to add flavor.

 I have been meaning to write about Citizen's for a month now. I find that it's a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of ""classy joints"". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I'd say laid back elegance, if you will.

The interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club ""Next"". It's sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles. 

I went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don't recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He's easy on the eyes too, so that helps.

For dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie's influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...

At the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT'S service!

I came in looking for a shoe in a specific size and color that i couldnt find anywhere else. When i called on the phone they said they only had the color i wanted in the size up from what i wanted but they had it in another color in the size i wanted. they said to come in try it and if i liked it they would have it delivered to my door for the same price.

Turns out that after i put some orthodics in the shoes for my flat feet i needed the larger size anyway so i was set to buy it. I had left my coupon at home however but instead of just telling me too bad so said they went above and beyond and to make it easy on me took 15% off my entire order (including socks and the shoe inserts) versus the $10 off planned (pretty much $22 bucks).

They were great in helping me get the best fit, best orthotic, and the best deal.

I will come shop here again based on the amazing service i got",1,XeoAojoz5johV2MQ5ngNig

I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't). 

This place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.

1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.

2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.

3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms. 

4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).

5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try. 

Rumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton.",1,-2gxrMHX8_F1Ep_ppWYTkw

Sometimes you find a great deal on just what you're looking for, sometimes you find something you didn't know you needed on sale, and sometimes there's nothing for you. Dubbed an outlet mall by most locals, you will find normal retail and full priced kiosk vendors mixed in with outlet shops like neimann marcus, jc penny, sears appliance, and burlington coat factory.

The outlet shops will usually save you a good 30-50% over retail cost, but sometimes less. I don't shop here often since it is about 10-15 miles from Central Phoenix; where I hail from, and I usually end up spending more than I prefer.

While not made with the traditional lamb the slow cooked pork was a good substitute. The Mexican Gyro, seems more a fancy name than an actual depiction of the food you are about to eat. I was half expecting a mexican spiced lamb with a chipotle or spicy yogurt sauce. It's more of a pork Gordita - an upscale taco   with corn salsa and sour cream dressings on a pita instead of corn tortilla.

Im always looking for the best deals around town, and unfortunately, I wouldn't really include this stop as one of them. After dropping $9+ with tax and tip, I was still a bit peckish. A small side salad; or side of any type, would really complete this as a meal.

The ambiance is 'cute.' The dining room is a dark, lofty, wine cellar-ish space with a Netflix projection on the back wall. Some tables have couch seating, especially on the patio, though most of the inside tables are wooden along with a few high tables. Like the couple seated next to us, it would be romantic and comfortable for those on a first date. 

We arrived around six PM on Saturday, a good hour before it would start getting any sort of busy. We were a bit disappointed to be seated at one of the uncomfortable wooden seating areas rather than be seated at a couch, but that's not the end of the world. Although, there was some sort of dark, sticky substance stuck under the table. I assumed it was a result of a balsamic vinegar spill but I'm not sure why it would have thickened to the under-table.

After being seated we waited an unusually long time before our waiter introduced himself... by that time we had already decided what we wanted to drink and an app start with. Instead of taking our drink order he let us know that select wines were on sale and that we should look those over for when he comes back, then he rushed back to the kitchen. When he came back we ordered the sangria carafe we'd previously intended to, to which he confirmed, ""just so you know, that isn't on sale."" I hope the service isn't this awkward when it's busy.

The sangria was nice and sweet with a surprising (and maybe a bit out of place) kick of cinnamon. 

We started with bruschetta planks - delicious and creative. For our meal we ordered the Porco pizza - I don't even like pork but it's hearty and shredded addition was undoubtably craveable. 

We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and licked that plate clean -- nuff said! Only before that my partner started to feed me a spoon of the dessert and THAT was when our waiter decided to stop by and see how we were doing. Laughing at the awkward, we were just fine.",0,vTinG2CDMZD2P46Bn4XJvg

Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest). 

The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened ""porch"" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy! 

We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.

We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool) 

So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book.",0,_qQJEA45k_E6EGE7vuzUDA

One thing that i love about BJ's is that I have always had good service, they do a great job of training and making sure that it is done right. Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their ""craft"" beers they are hit or miss. As a huge fan of a good beer I cant say I love BJ's brews but they also offer a decent other selection.

When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The ""deep dish"" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious! Best part about all the food i will say is the pizookie, i love the pizookie! you have to try it. 

Overall, BJ's is good a little bit pricey for what you get but they do a quality job on all the food and service and are fairly consistent in all their locations. Good place to go for a family dinner, beers with some friends, or just a place to go and have a decent meal.",1,0d8aK3J6erYIycfoVI259w

The drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.

Overall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory.",0,0d8aK3J6erYIycfoVI259w

Lately there has been a ton of construction that makes it impossible to get around and the signs for where the terminals are located just dont work. If your looking for which one of the 4 terminals your plane is leaving from you better know before you get there because your not going to find a sign that tells you. Luckily i know the airport well but its just a terrible system. THough they are now doing some construction to try and fix things (I hope).

Parking is a mess with the spiral parking garages and getting in. The one nice thing is the cell phone waiting lots that are actually really useful and pretty accommodating for a large airport. Parking cheap is just a good distance away on washington and is worth it if you have the time and AAA discounts. 

Inside the airport needs updating but is still better than many of the other airport in the country. Overall the inside is one of the best part of the airport with a good amount of places to eat and drink and alright walking between the different gates. Overall Sky harbor is a low level to middle of the pack airport that is going through some hopefully necessary upgrades but a mess otherwise especially for out of town people.",1,0d8aK3J6erYIycfoVI259w

Upon walking into LM I could tell I was going to dig this place. Exposed brick. Huge pizza oven. Activity. Welcoming host. Lots of chatter. All good things.

My first time there I was a little thrown off by their system. You don't wait to be seated, you wait in a line to order your food. While in said line they have someone get the number of people in your party, give you a number and then tell you where you're sitting. Once you order your food and pay, you sit at your table and wait for the food to come out. 

I dig eating breakfast here because of their self-service coffee bar. There is no waiting for a server to come refill your mug. Simply get out of your seat, carry your cup over, and then choose from one of 4 different types of joe.

The food I've had here is nothing to die for, but it's well done and presented nicely.

The 360 degree view of the valley and Camelback Mountain on the roof was perfect for an Arizona wedding. Our reception was right downstairs. The wedding dinner prepared was lobster and seafood pasta and prime rib, and it was by far the best food served at a wedding that I've ever had. We had open bar at the wedding and the drinks were not watered down and well prepared. The rooms are a little too contemporary for my taste, but the suite we stayed in was cool. 

Aside from our wedding, I'll add a couple of notes. The pool is some good fun and was filled with pretty folks. Cafe ZuZu in the hotel is okay, but not worth the price.

We knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered. 

My friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.

We decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the ""Brat Haus"". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal. 

I would be up to giving them another chance, it seems everyone else had a much better experience. I hate to leave bad reviews, but hey, you can't win them all!",5,X567tXHnrKhOLOyjsqf9pw

I feel I am in competition with myself to do the very best during that one hour. Amen brings that primal instincts within myself. So thank you Dallas for the inspiration. Thank you Amen for making me want to see & feel a better version of myself. 

First class is free. So if you're ready to to push yourself through primal fitness, head to http://www.amenzone.net/ and check it out. Cheers! PS...I've lost a total of 16 pounds & feelin' so much better about myself. :)",0,7F-DVLnGmC5hHPUVfSfxDw

Congrats to all those that helped put this event together. Volunteers and fans/suppoerters were awesome. This race is now in my Bucket List.

This year, I had to be up 4am so that I could drive to Westgate Mall and take a bus to be shuttled to the Start. Ugh. Race wasn't till 7:30am yet I had to wait almost an hour and a half before race began. We had to take a shuttle before a certain time or we were out of luck.
